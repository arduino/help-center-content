title: "My course teaches how to use Arduino technology. Can I use the Arduino logo in the certificate released upon completing my course?"

No, you may not use the Arduino logo. You may release a certificate that mentions Arduino as a learning objective, but using the logo could imply that the certificate is officially recognized by Arduino. This is not the case and it would constitute trademark violation.
