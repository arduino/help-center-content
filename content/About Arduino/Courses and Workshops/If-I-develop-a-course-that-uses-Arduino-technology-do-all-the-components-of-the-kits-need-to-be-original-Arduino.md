title: "If I develop a course that uses Arduino technology, do all the components of the kits need to be original Arduino?"

No, you can use whatever components you want for your courses. However, if you are using a compatible board (not an original Arduino board), you have to state that clearly in the description of the content of your course. Also, note that you may not name your course in a way that suggests that the course is endorsed, approved, or certified by Arduino, since doing so would constitute trademark violation.
