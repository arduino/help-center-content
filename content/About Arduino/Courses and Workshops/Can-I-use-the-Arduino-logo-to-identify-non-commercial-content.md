title: "Can I use the Arduino logo to identify non-commercial content?"

No, the same rules apply to non-commercial and commercial initiatives. However if you're running a non-commercial activity such as creating tutorials, managing a local community of Arduino users, opening up an Arduino-focused page online (ie. social networks) you may use the [Arduino Community Logo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Trademark/CommunityLogo).
