No, you do not need any special permission from us if you are including Arduino hardware or software in your courses. However, to avoid violating Arduino trademarks, you cannot name your course in a way that suggests it is officially endorsed, approved, or certified by Arduino. Additionally, using Arduino logos to identify the course would be a trademark violation, so make sure to use your own logo.

* **Permissible:** “Programming Course based on Arduino”, “Robotics Workshop for Arduino”
* **Non-permissible:** “Arduino Programming course”, “Arduino Robotics Workshop”
