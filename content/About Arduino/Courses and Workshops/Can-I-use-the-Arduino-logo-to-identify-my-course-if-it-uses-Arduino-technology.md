title: "Can I use the Arduino logo to identify my course if it uses Arduino technology?"

No, you may not use the Arduino logo in a way that suggests that your course is officially sponsored, endorsed, or certified by Arduino. The Arduino logo is a registered trademark, and using it to identify any third-party products, including courses, constitutes trademark violation.
