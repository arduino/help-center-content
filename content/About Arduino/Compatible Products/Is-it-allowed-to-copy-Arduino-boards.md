title: "Is it allowed to copy Arduino boards?"
---

The hardware designs of Arduino are open source; it is allowed to copy and further develop the designs. Note that in case a copy uses the Arduino name and/or logo on it, this board is no longer a copy but a counterfeit which is illegal to manufacture and sell.
