title: "I have used Arduino for my project, do I need to release my source code?"

The Arduino API and most libraries are covered by the [LGPL license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License), which do not require you to release your source code. The license does, however, require you to make available object files that allow for the relinking of the firmware against updated versions of the LGPL components.
We also offer dual licensing options for companies who want to include Arduino-based software in their products. Contact us at `license@arduino.cc`.
