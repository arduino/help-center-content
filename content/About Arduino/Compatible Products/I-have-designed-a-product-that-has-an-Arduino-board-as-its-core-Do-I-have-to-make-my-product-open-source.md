title: "I have designed a product that has an Arduino board as its core. Do I have to make my product open source?"

Physically embedding an Arduino board inside a commercial product does not require you to disclose or open-source any information about its design.

Note that even if you include an Arduino board in your own product you have not made an Arduino product. You need to use your own name and logo on it but may say that it includes an Arduino board. For instance: XYZ Robot Car, with an Arduino Nano.
