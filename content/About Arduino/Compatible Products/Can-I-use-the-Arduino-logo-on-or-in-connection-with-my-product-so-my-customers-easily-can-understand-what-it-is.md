A trademark is a symbol or a word representing a company or product. It is intended to identify a specific source of goods or services, protecting that source from confusion in the minds of consumers with other sources. The Arduino logo is a Trademark of Arduino SA and can not be used by third parties to identify other products, even if they derive from Arduino technology.

* The trademarks of Arduino SA may not be incorporated into any other trademark or logo.

* The trademarks of Arduino SA may not be used together with any third party marks that are confusingly similar to the trademarks of Arduino SA.
