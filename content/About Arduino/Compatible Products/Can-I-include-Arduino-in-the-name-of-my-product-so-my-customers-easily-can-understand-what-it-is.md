title: "Can I include Arduino in the name of my product, so my customers easily can understand what it is?"
---

It is understandable that you wish to make your customers aware that your product is based on Arduino. At the same time, if not properly explained, it can be misleading to your customers, who may think that they are purchasing an Arduino product when they are not.

You can make the reference to Arduino as long as it is perfectly clear to the customers what brand they are purchasing.

This is how you solve it:

* Include the words “based on”, “compatible with”, “for” or something similar.

* Always place the word Arduino last.

* Here below are a few examples to show what we mean. See the difference?

| Not okay | Okay |
|:--------:|:----:|
| Ladybird Arduino Shield | Ladybird Shield for Arduino |
| Arduino Butterfly Board | Butterfly Board - compatible with Arduino |
| Grasshopper Arduino Starter Kit | Grasshopper Starter Kit, based on Arduino |
