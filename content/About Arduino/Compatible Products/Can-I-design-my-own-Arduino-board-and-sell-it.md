title: "Can I design my own Arduino board and sell it?"
---

Since the hardware designs of Arduino are open source it is allowed to copy and further develop them. However this is not the same thing as making an Arduino board, only the company Arduino can design and produce Arduino products.

Your finished product is a product compatible with Arduino which should have its own name and brand. In case a copy uses the Arduino name and/or logo on it, this board is no longer a copy but a counterfeit which is illegal to manufacture and produce.
