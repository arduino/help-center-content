title: "Guidelines for content creation"
---

This article covers the basic trademark rules that must be followed when developing a course, workshop, or publication based on Arduino. By following these guidelines, you will be able to develop, share, and commercialize your content without violating Arduino’s Intellectual Property.

> Courses, workshops and publications refer to any kind of content about the Arduino technology and how it works. Examples include but are not limited to: video tutorials, free or paid online courses, in-person workshops, books and manuals, and websites.

* [Read more about Arduino’s different trademarks and the general conditions of use by third parties](https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark).

## Logo

You are not allowed to use the Arduino logo to identify or advertise your course, workshop, or publication. Using the Arduino logo to draw attention to your content is a trademark violation. You may use the logo in your course material when this is needed for explanatory and/or descriptive purposes.

If the content you are developing is not for profit (free for users, and you do not get any direct or indirect income from it, for example through affiliate links), you are allowed to use the [Arduino Community logo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Trademark/CommunityLogo).

> Please keep in mind that if you are planning to release a certificate that mentions Arduino as a learning objective, you are not allowed to use the Arduino logo on it. (This would imply that the certificate has been recognized by Arduino, which is not the case, and it constitutes a trademark violation)

## Name

You may include the word Arduino in the title of your course, workshop or publication if you use it in a descriptive way.
To avoid violating Arduino trademarks, you must name your course in a way that does not suggest it is officially endorsed, approved, or certified by Arduino.

## Licenses and fees

If you decide to open a website about Arduino, write a book, or develop a course or a workshop, you are free to do so, and you do not have to ask us for permission or pay any license fees. Similarly, if you commercialize your course or publication, you do not have to pay Arduino any royalty fees.

## Course content

You are allowed to use screenshots of Arduino IDE in your course content, provided that you mention its source. You are also free to use images of Arduino products in your course or publication.

All content on our website, including text and images, is distributed under Creative Commons license. This means you can use them on your own derived works, in part or completely, as long as you also adopt the same license.

* See [Software and Licensing based on Arduino](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415094490770-Distributing-products-based-on-Arduino).

> If your content includes the use of components (for example, if you develop a video tutorial), you are free to use whichever brand you choose. In other words, you do not have to use original Arduino products. However, you must provide correct descriptions of the components you use. If you are using a compatible board, you may not call it “Arduino”.

## Trademark Acknowledgments

All uses of the trademarks of Arduino SA should include an acknowledgment (for example: “Arduino<sup>®</sup> is a trademark of Arduino SA”). Please note that you should also include the registered trademark symbol the first time Arduino is mentioned in text: ARDUINO<sup>®</sup> or Arduino<sup>®</sup>.
