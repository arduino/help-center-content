A trademark is a symbol or a word representing a company or product. It is intended to identify a specific source of goods or services, protecting that source from confusion in the minds of consumers with other sources.

The Arduino logo is a Trademark of Arduino SA and can not be used by third parties to identify any publication.

In case your website is of non commercial character you may use the Community logo. You can find [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Trademark/CommunityLogo) more information about it and about how to use it.
