title: "I would like to write a publication or start a website about Arduino, do I need any special permission"

In general, we are happy to see and read different types of publications about Arduino. What is important to think about when you write about Arduino, is that it is clear to the reader that it is just that, about (not by) Arduino. Make sure that there is no confusion for the reader about who the author is. This will also allow the reader to identify with you as an author and help build your brand.

You don't need our permission but it is your responsibility to make sure you don't violate the trademarks of Arduino. In this section you will find the most common questions we receive regarding writing books and other publications.

If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.
