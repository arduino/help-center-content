title: "Can I use the Arduino logo in my publication or website?"

You may use the logo when it is needed for explanatory and/or descriptive purposes. The opposite, overuse of the Arduino logo, may be seen as if you use the Arduino brand to draw attention to your publication/website, which would then be a trademark violation.
