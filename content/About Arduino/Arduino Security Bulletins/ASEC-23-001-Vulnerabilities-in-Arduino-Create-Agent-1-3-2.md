## Impact

The identified vulnerabilities may allow an attacker, with local access to the victim machine, the following actions:

* Escalation of privileges to that of a user with credentials for the Arduino Create Agent service;
* Arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user running the Arduino Create Agent service;
* Arbitrary file deletion of files accessible by the user running the Arduino Create Agent service.

## Action Required

All users are advised to update the Arduino Create Agent to version 1.3.3 or later. An update is automatically initiated when visiting the Arduino Cloud Editor or when setting up a new device in Arduino Cloud. Alternatively, a manual update can be performed by downloading the new version of the software [here](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/releases).
