title: "ASEC-21-001 â€“ Vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j"
id: 4412377144338
---

In late 2021 a series of security vulnerabilities were found in **Apache Log4j**, a logging utility used by Arduino IDE 1.8 at the time. As of version 1.8.19, Log4j is no longer used by the IDE.

> [!NOTE]
> Arduino IDE 2 and Cloud services do not use Log4j and were not affected.

## Fixed in Arduino IDE 1.8.19

The Log4j library was removed in Arduino IDE 1.8.19.
