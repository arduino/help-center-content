Arduino offers two types of accounts for minors (including students):

* [Junior accounts](#Junior-accounts). For users below 14 years old (“Junior Accounts”).
* [Restricted accounts](#Restricted-accounts). For users at least 14 and under 16 years old (“Restricted Accounts”).

They differ in the features that users can access and the way that Arduino handles [personal data](https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/). Both account types require the minor's account to be linked to a person exercising parental authority (for convenience, we refer to this person as a “parent”). Learn more about Arduino accounts for minors below.

## Junior Accounts {#Junior-accounts}

This type of account is intended for minors under the age of 14. A junior account can be created by a parent or at the request of the minor (with parental consent) at **[app.arduino.cc/minors](https://app.arduino.cc/minors)**.

For a minor to [create a Junior Account](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360022234360-Create-an-Arduino-account-for-juniors#junior-request), the user is asked to choose a username and a picture (an Avatar) from a set of predetermined options, to enter a password of their choice, and to provide their date of birth. Usernames and avatars will not include any directly identifiable information relating to users.

When the minor initiates creation of the account, it is necessary to provide a parent’s email, and the parent must approve the account creation. Arduino will process the [personal data](https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/) of the parent. The parent will need to create an account if they don’t already have one in order to approve the creation of the Junior Account. If after 30 days the parent or guardian hasn’t created an account and approved creation of the Junior Account, the Junior Account will not be created and all data provided will be deleted promptly. 

A parent can also create a Junior Account by following the steps beginning on the profile page of the parent’s account and choosing a username and picture (an Avatar) from a set of predetermined options and providing a password and the minor’s date of birth. Usernames and avatars will not include any directly identifiable information relating to users.

The browsing activity of Junior Accounts will not be visible to Arduino.

**With a Junior Account, users are able to:**

* Access Educational products and services intended for middle school students (view the full list on [Arduino Education](https://www.arduino.cc/education)).
* Download and use Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* Download and use the Arduino Science Journal App. Use the Science Journal Apps only for creating experiments saved locally in the App. Sharing functionality with Google Drive is not made available to Junior Accounts.
* Obtain Arduino Certification.
* You may also visit the blog and forum but may not post comments.

### Upgrading to a Restricted account 

After turning 14, users of Junior accounts will be prompted to upgrade to a [Restricted Account](#Restricted-accounts), for users who are at least 14 and below 16 years old. When a Junior Account is upgraded to a Restricted Account, the user will be prompted to provide a username of their own choosing and an email address that will be linked to their account.

## Restricted Accounts {#Restricted-accounts}

The process for creating a Restricted Account is the same as that for creating a Junior Account above, and requires parental consent.  However, with a Restricted Account, the user has access to all the services available on the Arduino website, such as the on-line shop, Arduino Cloud, Arduino Project Hub, Arduino Forum, Arduino Blog, Arduino Day, Arduino Education products, Arduino Certification, the Contributor License Agreement program and the other development and educational instruments available on the Website and on the Apps.

A Restricted Account can be created by a parent or at the request of the minor (with parental consent) at **[app.arduino.cc/minors](https://app.arduino.cc/minors)**.

For a minor to [create a Restricted Account](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360022234360-Create-an-Arduino-account-for-juniors#junior-request), the user is asked to choose a username and a picture (an Avatar) from a set of predetermined options, to enter a password of their choice, and to provide their date of birth. Usernames and avatars will not include any directly identifiable information relating to users.

When the minor initiates creation of the account, it is necessary to provide a parent’s email, and the parent must approve the account creation. Arduino will process the [personal data](https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/) of the parent. The parent will need to create an account if they don’t already have one in order to approve the creation of the Restricted Account. If after 30 days the parent or guardian hasn’t created an account and approved creation of the Restricted Account, the Restricted Account will not be created and all data provided will be deleted promptly. 

A parent can also initiate creation of the account by [creating a junior account for the minor](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360022234360-Create-an-Arduino-account-for-juniors#adult-create). If the minor is at least 14 and below 16 years, as indicated by the date of birth provided by the parent, the Junior Account the minor will be prompted to upgrade as described in Upgrading to a Restricted Account.

The browsing activity of Restricted Accounts will not be visible to Arduino.
