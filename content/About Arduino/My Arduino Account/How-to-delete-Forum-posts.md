The posts can be deleted by pressing the Trash button which appears below the post.

Also, keep in mind that you can't delete a post if it has replies to the particular post as it requires consent from the user who posted the reply. Same is the case of deleting an entire topic if it already has reply. Deleting a post requires deleting each replies made by different users on the post.
