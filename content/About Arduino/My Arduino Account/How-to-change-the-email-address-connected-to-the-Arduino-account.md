Learn how to change the email address associated with your Arduino account. Note that it is not possible to change the email if your Arduino account uses a third-party sign-in option (such as Google Single Sign-On, for example).

Follow the steps below to change the email address:

1. Go to [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/) and sign in to your Arduino account using your current email and password.
