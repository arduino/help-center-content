Similar to the Arduino Forum, we have an active community on Discord. You can join the Discord channel using [this invite](https://discord.com/invite/jQJFwW7). The Arduino team is also an active part in the server and you can ask us for help at the #official-product-help channel.

After joining the server, make sure to read the welcome page to know the guidelines on using the sever. Also, make sure you choose the right channels to post your query.
