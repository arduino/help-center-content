You can review your active subscriptions on the [My Plans](https://digital-store.arduino.cc/subscriptions/plans) page, which can be opened anywhere on the Arduino website by clicking the ![profile symbol](img/symbol_profile.png) button in top-right, and then *My Plans*.

Here you can also:

* [Review, change or cancel your Arduino Cloud plan](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4401881299090-Review-change-or-cancel-your-Arduino-Cloud-plan)
* Change or cancel other plans
* Change the payment method for a plan
* View and change your billing information (in the *Billing* tab)
