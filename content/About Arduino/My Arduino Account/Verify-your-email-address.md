After completing the registration process, you should automatically receive a confirmation email in your inbox. It's an important step to finalize your account setup. If for some reason you haven't received the confirmation email, follow these steps to resend the email and complete the verification process.

## Re-send Verification Email

1. Sign in to your [Arduino account](https://www.arduino.cc/) in the top right corner.

1. Look for a dialog box at the bottom of the screen. Press **Resend email**

1. Everything should now function as intended, and your account should be successfully verified.

## If you haven't received the confirmation email
