If you come up with a situation where you created an Arduino account, and doesn't get an confirmation email to activate your account. Then, please check the instructions below:

* Please make sure that you have checked your spam folder of the email account.
* Make sure that you have not black listed the emails outside from your organization.
* You can resend the activation email from the Arduino website, logging in with the account you just created.

If you still didn't get the confirmation email, please escalate your case to the Arduino [support](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us) team.
