## What is Arduino Project Hub?

Arduino Project Hub is a website where people can share tutorials and descriptions of the projects they made with Arduino boards. It is a community-driven platform where users can upload their projects, share them with others, and collaborate on projects.

### Is Arduino Project Hub free to use?

Yes, Arduino Project Hub is free to use. Anyone can access the website, browse through the projects, and create an account to upload their own projects and tutorials.

### What kind of projects can I find on Arduino Project Hub?

Arduino Project Hub features a wide range of projects, from simple beginner projects to more advanced and complex projects. You can find projects in a variety of categories, including robotics, IoT, home automation, art installations, and more.

### Can I upload my own Arduino project to Arduino Project Hub?

Yes, you can upload your own Arduino project to Arduino Project Hub. To do so, you will need to create an account on the website and follow the content guidelines <!-- TODO: add link --> for uploading your project. It will be assessed by our admins to check if it complies with the guidelines, before being published.

## About the migration from Hackster.io

### Will my project appear on the new platform?

The new Arduino Project Hub platform has been populated with projects that had been created on the previous platform by users having an Arduino account:

* If your project was created with an Arduino account, it will be automatically imported.
* If your project was created with a Hackster.io account, it will **not** be automatically imported.

The migration of projects connected to Arduino accounts is happening in two phases:

* Projects created before Aug 2022 will be available on the new platform on Jan 1st 2023
* Projects created between Sep 2022 and Dec 2022 will be available on the new platform on Feb 1st 2023

### Can I manually transfer my project to the new platform?

Yes. The new platform provides the same editing capabilities, and the same support for attached files. In order to use it, you will have to create an Arduino account. After that you will be able to use the button “New Project” to create a new project with the same content and attachments.

### My project wasn't migrated correctly

Unfortunately there might have been technical issues during the migration of the content to the new platform, so you may find bugs or errors in your projects. In that case, get in touch with our [support team](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/), providing a link to the page where you found the bug and an explanation of what is wrong.
