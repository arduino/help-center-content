title: "I am not receiving any Arduino emails"
---

To mitigate potentially phishing campaigns and to protect our community and users from phishing attacks, Arduino has set the DMARC policy to validate the sent emails.

**Because of this policy, your email provider could move in your spam folder some emails we send**, especially if a third-party service relays them to you (e.g. if you are using the [private relay email service by Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425)).

* Please make sure that you have checked your spam folder of the email account.
* Make sure that you have not black listed the emails outside from your organization.
* In **Apple log-in**'s case, we advise to use the `share my email` option to be able to receive important communication in your inbox folder (order confirmation & tracking, account activation, etc).

## Still need help?

* If you still don't get our emails, please escalate your case to the Arduino [support](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us) team, providing the type of log in you use (username-password, Apple log-in or Google log-in) and listing the topics of the emails you believe are missing so we can re-send them to you or provide you with your missing information.

  1. Sign in to the [Arduino Store](https://store.arduino.cc/)
