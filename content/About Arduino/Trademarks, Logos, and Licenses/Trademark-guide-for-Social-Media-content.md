This guide covers the basic trademark rules for social media content about Arduino (for example: posts, reels, TikToks, vlogs). To comply with trademark regulations make sure that:

- Users do not mistake your content for something produced by or affiliated with Arduino.

- You don’t overuse Arduino to gain an unfair advantage by exploiting its popularity.

Please note that Arduino’s general Intellectual Property terms and conditions can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark).

## Logo

- You can use the Arduino Community logo on your posts, in your profile pictures, or as a watermark if your content is non-commercial.

- You cannot use the Arduino logo as a watermark on your post or in your profile picture.

- You cannot use the Arduino logo on your thumbnail.

## "Arduino" as a word

You can use the hashtag *#arduino* because we understand that it can also refer to the Arduino technology and all compatible products. You can use the word “Arduino” to add links to websites or marketplaces selling the products in your post or video **as long as you do it correctly**:

| Do | Don't|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Only use “Arduino” to link to sites selling genuine Arduino products | Avoid using “Arduino” as a link to compatible products |

## Product pictures

Use the right pictures. You can use pictures of Arduino boards if you are talking about original Arduino; otherwise, choose pictures of the products you are actually using. If your content refers to a compatible board (not the original Arduino) make sure to refer to it correctly.

| Do | Don't|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| "This is a UNO board, compatible with Arduino" | "This is an Arduino UNO" |
