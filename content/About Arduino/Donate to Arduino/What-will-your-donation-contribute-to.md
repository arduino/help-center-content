Your contribution counts towards the development of the Arduino open source software. We believe that software should be free to be used by anyone, and we want to ensure that it is kept that way.

The Arduino tools and libraries are being used by millions of people worldwide, including schools, companies, workshops and many third party products designed specifically to be used with this software. Donations ensure that these efforts continue to evolve, improve and are maintained regularly.

Your donation is used to improve our open source efforts which are free and available for everyone. Some of these efforts include:

* The Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* arduino-cli
* Libraries
* Arduino API for AVR, SAM, SAMD, mbed and more
* Documentation and tutorials
* Forum and community initiatives
