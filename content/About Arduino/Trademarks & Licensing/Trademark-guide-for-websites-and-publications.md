This guide covers the basic trademark rules for publications about Arduino (examples include but are not limited to: books, articles, dissertations, websites, and blogs). By following these guidelines, you will be able to develop, share, and even commercialize your content without violating Arduino’s Intellectual Property.

Please note that Arduino’s general Intellectual Property terms and conditions can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark).

## Logo

You **cannot** use the Arduino logo:

- on the cover of the book or the book spine

- as an identifier of your site or blog (for example in the header, footer, thumbnail, or favicon)

You **can** use the Arduino logo in the contents as long as it is used to explain what Arduino is (Example:  “Arduino is an open source electronics company, this is their logo: ![Arduino Logo](img/Mini_logo.png)“)

You **can** use the **Arduino Community Logo** on your website or blog if it is **non-commercial**. Please note that “non-commercial” means any use or activity where a fee is not charged and the purpose is not the sale of a good or service, and the use or activity is not intended to produce a profit.

## Name

### For Books

Choose a title that clearly indicates that the book is about Arduino but it’s not sponsored by or affiliated with Arduino. Remember to use the symbol Ⓡ after “Arduino” the first time you use the word in the text (it is not necessary to use the ® on the cover). Provide trademark acknowledgment (“Arduino is a registered trademark of Arduino SA”).

### For Websites

Make sure your domain name **does not contain the word “Arduino”** in full or in part. If you want to use “Arduino” in the name of your site (if it’s different from your domain name), find a name that clearly expresses that your site is about Arduino, but not created by or affiliated with Arduino. Always use the word Arduino last.

## Product Names and Pictures

You are not obliged to use pictures of genuine Arduino products in your publications. It is perfectly fine to use compatible products, as long as you refer to them correctly. Use the correct product names as much as possible, and *at least the first time you mention them*.
