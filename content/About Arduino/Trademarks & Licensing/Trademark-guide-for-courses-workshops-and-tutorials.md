This guide covers the basic trademark rules you must follow when developing a course, workshop, or tutorial based on Arduino (Examples include but are not limited to: video tutorials, free or paid online courses, and in-person workshops). By following these guidelines, you will be able to develop, share, and even commercialize your content without violating Arduino’s Intellectual Property.

Please note that Arduino’s general Intellectual Property terms and conditions can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark)

## Logo

You are not allowed to use the Arduino logo to identify or advertise your course, workshop, or tutorial. Using the Arduino logo to draw attention to your content is a trademark violation.

You may use the logo in your course material only when it is needed for explanatory and/or descriptive purposes.
If the content you are developing is not for profit (free for users, and you do not get any direct or indirect income from it, for example through affiliate links), you are allowed to use the [Arduino Community logo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark/community-logo).

Please keep in mind that if you are planning to release a certificate that mentions Arduino as a learning objective, you are **not allowed to use the Arduino logo** on it. This would imply that the certificate has been recognized by Arduino, which is not the case, and it constitutes trademark violation.

## Name

You may include the word Arduino in the title of your course, workshop or tutorial if you use it descriptively.
To avoid violating Arduino trademarks, you must name your course in a way that **does not suggest** it is officially endorsed, approved, or certified by Arduino.

## Licenses and fees

You do not have to ask us for permission or pay any license or royalty fees to develop and commercialize your content.
