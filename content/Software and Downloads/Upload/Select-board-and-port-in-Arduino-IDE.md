3. Hover over the _Board_ row to reveal the installed board packages. These packages contain some popular boards:

   | Package                                      | Boards                                                                      |
   |----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Arduino AVR boards                           | Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, Arduino Nano (classic)                           |
   | Arduino megaAVR boards                       | Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2, Arduino Nano Every                                   |
   | Arduino SAMD (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+) Boards | MKR Zero, MKR WiFi 1000, MKR WiFi 1010, and other MKR boards                |

## Select port

1. Click on _Tools_ in the menu bar.

2. Find the _Port_ row. The currently selected board will be selected.

3. Hover over the _Port_ to reveal all ports. For Arduino devices, the board name will typically be displayed after the port.

   Port naming varies by system:

   * Windows: `COM3 (Arduino Uno)`
   * macOS: `/dev/cu.usbmodem14101 (Arduino Uno)`
   * Linux: `/dev/ttyACM0 (Arduino Uno)`

4. Click on a port to select it.
