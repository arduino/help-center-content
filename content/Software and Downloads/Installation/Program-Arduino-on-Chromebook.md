Arduino boards can be programmed on Chrome OS with the [Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor). Since Chrome OS does not run executables, the Arduino IDE cannot be used.

To use the Web Editor, you need to install the [Arduino Create for Education app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elmgohdonjdampbcgefphnlchgocpaij) from the Chrome Web Store.
