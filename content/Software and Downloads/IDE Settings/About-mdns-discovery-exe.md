Arduino IDE includes an [mDNS discovery tool](https://github.com/arduino/mdns-discovery) to find available network ports. Arduino IDE automatically updates this tool whenever a new version becomes available but Windows Firewall will not automatically permit the new version to communicate on the network. When a new version has been installed you will receive an alert and asked to allow access.
