Arduino IDE includes an [mDNS discovery tool](https://github.com/arduino/mdns-discovery) which is used to find available network ports.

When a new version of mdns-discovery is available, Arduino IDE will automatically try to download it. The new version may be treated as a new application by your computer. For this reason, you may have to allow the application to communicate on the network after an update. You can see the [release history for mdns-discovery here](https://github.com/arduino/mdns-discovery/releases).
