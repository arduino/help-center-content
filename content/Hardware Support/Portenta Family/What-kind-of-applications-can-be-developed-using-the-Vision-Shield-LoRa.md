The Vision Shield LoRa® lets you run low-cost sound and vision MicroPython applications on your Portenta H7. Enable long-range and low-power wireless connections for your projects with LoRa®, upload data to the Arduino Cloud or your own infrastructure, and activate your system upon detection of images or sound events.

The Vision Shield LoRa provides a great solution for scenarios that involve object detection, image filtering and classification, QR code scanning, sound detection, and other applications. Thanks to the LoRa connectivity, your Portenta H7 can share collected data with the rest of the world over The Things Network (TTN), and trigger events based on the results.

The high-sensitivity image sensors can capture gestures, ambient light, proximity, and be used for object identification. Furthermore, the two omnidirectional, built-in microphones can add sound to video recordings and store them on a MicroSD Card.

Use case examples:

* Counting people passing by a certain point in a remote location
* Detecting sound activity in a specific remote location
* Detection of a specific object in an image
* Face and blob detection at remote location
