The Portenta family incorporates **two 80 pin high-density connectors** on the bottom of the board. This ensures scalability for a wide range of applications, offering more features and increasing connectivity.

In order to access the pins located in the high-density connectors easily during prototyping Arduino has developed the [Portenta Breakout](https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-breakout) board. But if you'd rather implement your project directly you will need to know the connector type and part number:

The part number of the connector is [DF40C-80DP-0.4V(51)](https://www.hirose.com/product/p/CL0684-4001-8-51) and the mating connector required is [DF40HC(3.5)-80DS-0.4V](https://www.hirose.com/en/product/p/CL0684-4162-7-51).

This will let you attach your own shields and connect components directly to the Portenta H7 board.
