Qwiic is a system of breakout modules and development boards that use a specific connector for easy I2C communication.

Wiring I2C devices can be complicated, but Qwiic simplifies this with pre-made cables, allowing you to connect additional sensors and actuators without soldering. You can chain devices together using a single cable, enabling them to work right away.

## Modulino Nodes and Qwiic compatibility{#modulino-nodes-and-qwiic-compatibility}

Modulino nodes are compatible with the entire Qwiic ecosystem, both mechanically and electrically. They can be connected in series with other Qwiic components. This setup uses I2C communication, making it simple to add multiple devices without complex wiring.
