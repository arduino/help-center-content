## What is LoRaWAN?

LoRaWAN® is a radio frequency protocol that allows devices to connect to the Internet over a long range with very low power consumption. The LoRaWAN specification stands for Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) and it is designed to wirelessly connect devices to regional, national or global networks, specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT).

This protocol is particularly useful for environments with limited connectivity and long distances between the main microcontroller and the components linked to it. It is also very simple to set up an access point yourself if there is no coverage in your area and operating costs are very low.

## Suitable use cases

LoRaWAN is suitable for:

- **Long range** - multiple kilometers
- **Low power** - can last years on a battery
- **Low cost** - less than 20€ CAPEX per node, almost no OPEX
- **Low bandwidth** - between 250bit/s and 11kbit/s in Europe using LoRa modulation (depending on the spreading factor)
- **Coverage anywhere** - you are the network! Just install your own gateways
- **Secure** - 128bit end-to-end encryption

## Limitations

LoRaWAN is not suitable for every application. Since LoRaWAN can only send small packages every couple of minutes, applications involving real-time data, phone calls, home automation, file transfers or streaming are not suitable.
