There are several Arduino products that incorporate LoRaWAN® connectivity capabilities, allowing your devices to connect directly to a LoRaWAN® network or the Arduino IoT Cloud. This is a great solution for your Arduino microcontroller to interact wirelessly with the internet via TTN or Arduino IoT Cloud. All different Arduino devices incorporating LoRa® connectivity are listed and explained below.

## Portenta Vision Shield LoRa®

The [Portenta Vision Shield LoRa®](https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-vision-shield-lora) will let you run vision applications on your Portenta H7 while connected wirelessly via LoRa® to the Arduino Cloud, TTN, or your own infrastructure. The Vision Shield comes equipped with a camera and microphone that will allow you to run low-cost sound and vision applications involving object detection, image filtering and classification, QR code scanning, sound detection, and more.

Get started now with the [following tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-vision-shield/connecting-to-ttn) to learn how to connect Portenta H7 with the Vision Shield LoRa® to the TTN.

## MKR WAN 1300 and MKR WAN 1310

The Arduino [MKR WAN 1310](https://store.arduino.cc/mkr-wan-1310) and [MKR WAN 1300](https://store.arduino.cc/mkr-wan-1310) boards allow you to connect your sensors and actuators over long distances using the LoRa® wireless protocol or throughout LoRaWAN™ networks. These boards can be connected to the [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot), your own LoRa® network using the **Arduino LoRa® PRO Gateway**, existing LoRaWAN™ infrastructure like The Things Network, or even other boards using the direct connectivity mode.

## LoRa® Pro Gateway

The Arduino Pro Gateway interconnects your LoRa® devices with the Arduino Cloud via LoRa® Spread Spectrum, FSK, GFSK. This is optimized for the Arduino WAN 1310 and compatible with the MKR WAN 1300. This solution allows you to run multiple MKR WAN boards connected via LoRa® to the Pro Gateway. Then, all the information collected from the devices can be managed in the Arduino Cloud through the gateway.
