Missing or corrupted **USB-to-Serial** firmware can cause UNO (Rev1 and Rev3) and Mega boards to be recognized as any of the following:

- Unknown Device
- Composite Device
- ATmega16u2 DFU
- Atmega8U2 DFU

Resolve the issue by [flashing the USB-to-Serial firmware in DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4408887452434).
