Some Arduino boards come with an embedded Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in them. To easily access read data from the IMU, you can use a library.

## Find an IMU library for other boards

Here are some tips to find an IMU library for a non-Arduino board:

* Check the technical specifications for the board and determine the name of the IMU sensor. Use a search engine to look for compatible libraries.
* Go to <a class="link-external" href="https://search.arduino.cc/search?tab=reference">search.arduino.cc and search for "imu" or a specific name in the Documentation tab</a>.
* Contact your reseller or the board manufacturer.
