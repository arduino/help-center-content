## General advice

* Wash your hands before working with your board.
* Avoid dust build-up by using a case or putting the board away when not in use. Smaller amounts of dust can be removed using any readily available air duster.
* Despite the temptation to carry on with your project through dinner, try to avoid eating and drinking whilst using your Arduino board.

## How to clean your board

Accidents happen. Follow these steps if you need to thoroughly clean your board:

1. Disconnect your board from your computer or battery.
2. Use an air duster or dry cloth to remove any loose debris.
3. Use an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) wipe to safely remove grease, dirt and dust from the board. Apply only gentle pressure to avoid damaging board components.
4. Allow the IPA to evaporate before running the board.

## Covid-19 and sharing boards

Arduino and open source is all about sharing ideas and working together but the challenges posed by Covid-19 require special care. If you are intending to share your Arduino board with other people (e.g. in a classroom setting), we recommend a 222 nm ultraviolet disinfection cabinet for safe disinfection between use.
