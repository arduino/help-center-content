The MKR NB 1500 is the only board with **Narrowband communication** so it is the perfect choice for devices in remote locations without an Internet connection. This board communicates via Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) which is a subsection of the LTE standard with a limited bandwidth (200KHz).

Thus, this board requires a SIM card from a **compatible mobile carrier** providing NB IoT service and the type of SIM this board fits is the 3FF (AKA Micro-SIM) format.
