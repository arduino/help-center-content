Every MKR FOX 1200 comes with a **free one-year subscription** to Sigfox data plan which is useful for testing the Sigfox network.

In the first configuration example tutorial here: [Sigfoxfirstconfiguration](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SigFoxFirstConfiguration) you'll find the steps needed to register your board on the Sigfox network.

> [!NOTE]
> The ID and PAC numbers required for the Sigfox subscription are preflashed into the MKRFOX1200 during the time of manufacture, and they can be found in the serial monitor after running the first configuration example.
