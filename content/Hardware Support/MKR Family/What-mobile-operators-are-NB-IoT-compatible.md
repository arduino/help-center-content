Not all mobile network providers offer NB-IoT or LTE-M at this time, neither this service is available in every country just yet. You must check that the **operator you are intending to use has a NB-IoT/LTE-M plan** to offer before starting our project with the MKR NB 1500.

Here you can check a detailed map of [mobile IoT deployment](https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map) across the world. Just click on the country of your interest to see the list of mobile providers available. Operators currently offering service in that part of the spectrum include (among others):

* Vodafone
* AT&T
* T-Mobile USA
* Telstra
* Verizon
