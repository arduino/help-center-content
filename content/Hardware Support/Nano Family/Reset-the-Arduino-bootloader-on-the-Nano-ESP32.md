title: Reset the Arduino bootloader on the Nano ESP32

Learn how to reset the default Arduino bootloader on the Nano ESP32 using Arduino IDE.

These are some reasons you may want to reset the bootloader:

* Update the Arduino bootloader already on the board. This can resolve issues with Nano ESP32 being misidentified as other ESP32 boards.
* Restore the ability to upload regular Arduino sketches to a Nano ESP32 that has been flashed with the MicroPython firmware.

In this article:

* [Option 1: Using the bootloader mode](#bootloader-mode)
* [Option 2: Use the Esptool programmer option](#esp32-download-mode)

> [!TIP]
> Before you begin, it is recommended to have the latest version of the **Arduino ESP32 Boards** or **esp32** boards package installed using the Board Manager.

## Option 1: Using bootloader mode {#bootloader-mode}

The quickest way to reset your Arduino Nano ESP32 is by activating the bootloader mode.

Follow these steps:

1. Press the RST button two times, waiting 0.3 to 1 second between each press.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The timing between presses is different compared to bootloader mode on most other Arduino boards. If bootloader mode wonâ€™t activate, try adjusting your timing.

2. Check the on-board LED near the RST button:
   * **If the LED pulses slowly in green[^colors]:** The board is in bootloader mode. Go to the next step.
   * **If the LED is off:** Repeat step 1 or try [Option 2: Use the Esptool programmer option](#esp32-download-mode).
3. Select Arduino Nano ESP32 in Arduino IDE or the Cloud Editor.
4. Upload any sketch to restore the standard Arduino bootloader.

## Option 2: Use the Esptool programmer option {#esp32-download-mode}

Follow these steps:

1. Connect a jumper cable between the **GND** and **B1** pins. The RGB LED will turn on with a green[^colors] color.

2. While the **GND** and **B1** pins are shorted, press the white **RST** button on the top of the board to reset the board to **firmware download mode**.

3. Remove the jumper cable. The RGB LED should stay on, in a purple[^colors] color.

4. Open Arduino IDE.

5. Go to **Tools > Port** and select the board (it may be identified as an arbitrary ESP32 board).

6. Go to **Tools > Board** and select **Arduino ESP32 Boards > Arduino Nano ESP32** (or **esp32 > Arduino Nano ESP32** if you're using the full esp32 package).

7. Open the **Tools > Programmer** menu.

8. Click on the **Esptool** option to select it.

9. Select **Sketch > Upload Using Programmer** to begin uploading the firmware.

   The process is complete when you see these lines:

   ```
   Leaving...
   Hard resetting via RTS pin...
   ```

10. Press the **RST** button on top of the board to exit firmware download mode.

### Troubleshooting

#### dfu-util: No DFU capable USB device available

If you see this error, it means that the sketch is still being uploading with the regular upload process.

Try this:

* Ensure that the **Esptool** option is selected in the **Sketch > Upload Using Programmer** menu. It needs to be actively selected, even if no other options are available. You will know the Esptool option is selected if a checkmark is displayed next to the name.

* Ensure you are uploading the sketch by selecting **Sketch > Upload Using Programmer** and not by clicking the regular Upload button.

[^colors]: On some earlier versions of the Nano ESP32, the LED will be blue instead of green, and yellow instead of purple.
