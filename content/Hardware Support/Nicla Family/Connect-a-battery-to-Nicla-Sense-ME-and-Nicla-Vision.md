The Nicla Sense ME and the Nicla Vision are compatible with a single cell 3.7 V Li-Po or Li-Ion battery which connects to a 3-pin BM03B-ACHSS-GAN-TF connector.

Usually, these batteries do not come with the right mating connector to fit the Nicla Sense ME or Nicla Vision. Therefore, the right connector type needs to be acquired separately and installed manually onto the battery end.

The easiest way to attach the battery to the connector is using pre-crimped wires. Simply 'click in' each pre-crimped wire in the connector. Then, connect the other end of the pre-crimped wires to the corresponding polarity on the battery as explained later in this article. Use your preferred connection method (soldering or wire connector) to join the pre-crimped wires to the battery. Specific details for the battery connector and crimped wires are listed below:

## Compatible parts

### Battery Connector

* Manufacturer: JST
* Part Number: ACHR-03V-S
* Description: CONN RCPT ACH W-B 3POS 1.2MM

### Pre-Crimped Wires

* Manufacturer: JST
* Part Number: ASACHSACH28Wxxx
* Description: JUMPER SACH-003G-P0.2

## Connecting the battery

The battery connector has three connection pins whereas Li-Po and Li-Ion batteries usually only come with two wires. This is because some batteries come with a third connection that is used as a thermistor or temperature sensor.

This is how it looks for the Nicla Sense ME/Nicla Vision (red is '+' and black is GND). If you place the board with the connector side up and the micro USB connector facing upwards (as in the image below), the positive wire of the battery connects with the upper pin on the connector. The middle one is left empty and the negative wire from the battery connects to the lower pin on the connector.

**Note that the image is for schematic illustration purposes and does not show the pre-crimped wires. In case pre-crimped wires are being used, they are connected between the battery connector and the battery wires.**
