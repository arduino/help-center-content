## Windows

1. Unplug any non-essential USB devices from your computer.
1. Connect the UNO R4 WiFi board to your computer with the USB cable.
1. Download <a class="link-download" href="https://github.com/arduino/uno-r4-wifi-usb-bridge/releases/latest/download/unor4wifi-update-windows.zip">unor4wifi-update-windows.zip</a>
1. [Unzip](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc) the downloaded file.
1. Double-click on the `update.bat` file that is in the unzipped folder.
   > **Note:** Depending on your Windows security settings, a **Windows protected your PC** dialog may open with this message:
   >
   > _Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk._
   >
   > Click the **More info** link in the dialog and then click the **Run anyway** button to continue.
1. A terminal window will open. The terminal window might now show a list of the serial ports present on your computer.

   For example:

   ```text
   Start flashing firmware
   [2023-07-11T06:39:09Z INFO ] Detected 2 serial ports
   [2023-07-11T06:39:09Z INFO ] Ports which match a known common dev board are highlighted
   [2023-07-11T06:39:09Z INFO ] Please select a port
   ❯ COM1
     COM43 - USB Serial Device (COM43)
   ```

### Troubleshooting for macOS

* If you get a `Cannot put the board in ESP mode. (via 'unor4wifi-reboot')` error: disconnect and reconnect the board, then run the command again.
* If you get an `xattr: bin/espflash: No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine` or `xattr: bin/espflash: No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine` error, it means that the command has already been run, or is otherwise not needed. Proceed with the next step.
