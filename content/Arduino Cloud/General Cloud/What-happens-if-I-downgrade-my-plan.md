title: "What happens if I downgrade my plan?"
---

These are some things to keep in mind if you change your Arduino Cloud plan from a paid plan to a free or cheaper plan.

---

## Your plan is valid until the end of the billing cycle

When requesting a downgrade, your current plan will be active until the end of the billing cycle. You will retain access to all plan features until then. In the meantime, the plan change will appear as queued in your account, where it can be canceled if you change your mind.

---

## Feature limits may be exceeded

When the plan change goes into effect, new feature limits will apply to your account. If these limits are exceeded, certain features may be disabled.
