The Arduino Cloud allows you to take your projects to a new level with IoT connectivity. By connecting your boards as *Things* in the cloud you can download and upload data, share it between different Things, trigger webhooks, and more.

The Arduino Cloud requires a subscription plan. We provide four options â€“ *Free*, *Entry*, *Maker*, and *Maker Plus*. Paid plans are offered on a monthly and yearly billing cycle, except the Entry plan, which is only available on a yearly basis.

The different plans provide different limits for storage and the number of things you can configure. The advanced plans provide additional features such as APIs, 'Over the Air' updating of code, and more.

To read more, and sign up for your plan, please [visit the Arduino Store](https://www.arduino.cc/cloud/plans).
