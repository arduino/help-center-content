## About Arduino Cloud plans {#about}

> [!NOTE]
> All premium features for individual users are now consolidated into a single **Maker plan**. Arduino Cloud can still be used with the Free plan, but Entry and Maker Plus plans are no longer offered to new customers.

Cloud plans enable or improve the features of a single space in Arduino Cloud:

* Individual plans increase the limits of your **Private Space**.
* Enterprise plans increase the limits of the shared space displayed below the text "Enterprise Plan".
* School plans increase the limits of the shared space under "Plan details".

See [Review your current plans](https://digital-store.arduino.cc/subscriptions/plans) to understand where the features of each plan are active.
