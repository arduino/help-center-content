**If you change plan (regardless of monthly or yearly billing):**

* If changing from a paid plan to the free plan, or a cheaper plan, the change will take effect from the next billing cycle.
* If you're upgrading to a more advanced plan, the change will take place immediately. Any remaining time from your current plan will be discounted from future charges on the new plan.

**If you change between the monthly and yearly billing options, while keeping the same plan:**

* If changing from a yearly to a monthly plan, the change will take effect from the next billing cycle.
* If changing from a monthly to a yearly plan, the change will take place immediately. Any remaining time from your current plan will be discounted from future charges on the new plan.

Note that switching to a lower plan may cause you to [exceed limits on data storage, Things, and more](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4401874212370-If-you-exceed-plan-limits-after-downgrading).
