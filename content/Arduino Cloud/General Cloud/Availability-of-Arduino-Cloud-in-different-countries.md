Arduino Cloud is not available in the following countries:

* Belarus
* Cuba
* Iran
* Libya
* Myanmar
* North Korea
* Russia
* Sudan
* Syria
* Ukraine
* Zimbabwe

Specifically, these restrictions apply:

* You will be unable to use Arduino Cloud or purchase an Arduino Cloud plan.
* Because some ancillary services used by Arduino Cloud block access to these countries, using Arduino Cloud is not possible even with the Free plan.

If you are in a different country or region and have issues accessing Arduino Cloud or purchasing an Arduino Cloud plan, please [contact us](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/).
