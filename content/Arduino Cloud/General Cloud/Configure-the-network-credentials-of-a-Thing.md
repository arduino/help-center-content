    Click the "Configure" button to enter your network credentials.

    - Wi-Fi: Enter your Wi-Fi name (SSID) and password (encryption key).
    - Arduino SIM: Use these credentials.
    - Arduino with LoRaÂ®: The credentials are added automatically.
    - ESP32 and ESP8266: Enter the secret key that was provided when adding the device.

## Configuring network credentials with an imported template

1. Find a [Template](https://app.arduino.cc/templates) and click "Import Template" (If you have issues importing the template, you can find more information [here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4408887422994-If-you-can-t-import-a-template-in-Arduino-Cloud))

1. Plug in your device and wait for it be detected. Once the device is detected, click on 'Configure' to continue.

## Configuring a Thing with previously set network credentials

1. Go to the [Things tab](https://app.arduino.cc/things) and select the Thing that needs its network credentials updated.

1. In your Thing's settings, find the Network section and click the button labeled "Change" to edit the network credentials.

1. Re-enter your Wi-Fi credentials with your Wi-Fi Name (SSID) and Password. Ensure there are no typos and the credentials match those set on your router.

1. Open the sketch and click the Upload button to properly apply the new network settings to your device.
