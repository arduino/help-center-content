![There has been an Error.
Error trying to install file: destination ${windows_folder_startup) resolved to an empty value

## If you are the only user

The error can often be resolved by running the installation with admin privileges. To do this, right-click on the installation file and select _Run as administrator_.

## If there are multiple users

* Try running the installation with admin privileges. To do this, right-click on the installation file and select _Run as administrator_.
* If there is an admin account, sign in to it, and try running the installation from there.

Contact the system administrator if you don't have the relevant permissions.
