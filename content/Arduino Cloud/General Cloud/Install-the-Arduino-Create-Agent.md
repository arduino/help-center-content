## Troubleshooting

### General tips

* Be sure that you have **administrator permission** on your machine; if the computer you are using is not your own personal computer, ask your IT administrator for an upgraded profile.
* Sometimes the agent installation can be blocked by the firewall or antivirus software; in the latter case, you can try to **add the agent to your Antivirus whitelist**.

### Old agent installation of the Arduino Create Agent found

2. Open the Applications folder (`~/Applications`) within your user folder.
