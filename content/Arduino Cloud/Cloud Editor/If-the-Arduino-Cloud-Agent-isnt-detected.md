## Troubleshooting

1. **Install the Arduino Cloud Agent:**  If you haven't already done so, [install the Arduino Cloud Agent](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome). If the Cloud Agent is still not detected, follow the next troubleshooting steps.

2. **Ensure the Arduino Cloud Agent is Running:** Check if the [Arduino Cloud Agent is running](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4980687506844), as it may be *off* or *paused*.

3. **Brave Browser Users:** If you are using [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), see [Use Arduino Cloud with Brave Browser](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/10482021304988-Use-Arduino-Cloud-with-Brave-Browser) for specific instructions.

4. **Safari on macOS Users:** Ensure the HTTPS certificate for Safari is installed:  
    1. Open the Arduino Cloud Agent menu (Look for the ![Arduino Cloud Agent icon](img/cloud-agent-logo-mac.png) icon in the top-right of the menu bar of macOS).
    2. Click on the *Manage HTTPS certificate* menu and make sure that the certificate is installed and trusted.  
       If itâ€™s not, you can click on the button "Install the certificate for Safari".
    3. Enter the administrative credentials, if prompted.
    4. Refresh the Safari browser window.

5. **Mac Computers with Apple Silicon (e.g., M1 chip):** Ensure you have [installed Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).

If you are still experiencing issues, [uninstall the Arduino Cloud Agent](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014869840) and then [reinstall it](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome).
