Learn what to do if the Arduino Cloud Agent isn't detected by the [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/).

If you haven't done so, [install the Arduino Cloud Agent](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome). If you still encounter one of the warnings bellow, follow the [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

* `Arduino Cloud Agent not found`
* `To upload a sketch via USB port, make sure the Agent is installed and running on this computer`

## Troubleshooting

1. Check if the [Arduino Cloud Agent is running](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4980687506844), since sometimes it may be **off** or **paused**.

2. If you are using [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), see [Use Arduino Cloud with Brave Browser](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/10482021304988-Use-Arduino-Cloud-with-Brave-Browser).

3. **If you're using Safari on macOS:** Check if the HTTPS certificate for Safari has been installed:
    1. Open the Arduino Cloud Agent menu (Look for the ![Arduino Cloud Agent icon](img/cloud-agent-logo-mac.png) icon in the top-right of the menu bar of macOS).
    2. Click on the **Manage HTTPS certificate** menu and make sure that the certificate is installed and trusted.  
       If itâ€™s not, you can click on the button "Install the certificate for Safari".
    3. Enter the administrative credentials, if prompted.
    4. Refresh the Safari browser window.

4. If you're using the [Cloud Agent on a Mac computer with an Apple Silicon processor](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent#apple-m1-support) (e.g. Apple M1 chip), make sure to [install Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).

If you are still having issues, [uninstall the Arduino Cloud Agent](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014869840) and [reinstall it](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome).
