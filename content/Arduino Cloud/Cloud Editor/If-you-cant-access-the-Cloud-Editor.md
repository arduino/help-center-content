When accessing the [Cloud Editor](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/13809101080732-Open-the-Cloud-Editor), you may encounter one of these issues:

* You get signed out when trying to access the Cloud Editor
* The Cloud Editor doesn't load
* You see one of these messages for an extended period:
  * _It's just one of those days. We're doing our best to get things back up and running._
  * _Please wait a few seconds while we get your Arduino Cloud started_

Check the following:

* If you are using a [junior account](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4839080453148-About-Arduino-accounts-for-minors#Junior-accounts), use the [dedicated sign-in page](app.arduino.cc/minors).
