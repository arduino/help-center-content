When using the Arduino Cloud Free plan, you are limited to 25 compilations per day in the Cloud Editor and Arduino Cloud. The number counting toward the limit is reset every midnight (00:00) in your local time.

For unlimited compilation, you can [upgrade to any paid plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans) or use the [desktop Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
