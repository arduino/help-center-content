title: "I have installed the Create Agent, but the board is not recognized..."

These are general approaches to take if you are experiencing problems with the board recognition in the [Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor).

---

* After installation, take into account that it will take some time for the drivers to get installed. This is an automatic process done by the Arduino Create Agent.

* Make sure you are using the Web Editor in the same browser the Create Agent was installed.

* Try to avoid USB 3.0, since it has been found that it can cause some issues.

* Try to reinstall the Arduino Create Agent and make sure that you give required permissions (sometimes browsers automatically deny hidden pop-ups).

## But it was working just a while ago

* Try to reset the board by pressing the reset button on it while it is connected to the computer.

* Try to clear the cache in your browser.

* Check if the USB cable you are using is working and it is correctly connected to the computer.
