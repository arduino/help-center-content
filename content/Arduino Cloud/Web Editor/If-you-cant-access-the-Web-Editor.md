When accessing the **Cloud Editor** ([create.arduino.cc/editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)), you may encounter one of these issues:

* You get signed out when trying to access the Cloud Editor
* The Cloud Editor doesn't load
* You see one of these messages for an extended period:
  * _It's just one of those days. We're doing our best to get things back up and running._
  * _Please wait a few seconds while we get your Arduino Cloud started_

Check the following:

* **Use a supported account type.** The Web Editor is currently not available when signed in with a [junior account](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4839080453148-About-Arduino-accounts-for-minors).
* **Use a supported browser with JavaScript enabled:**
  * [See supported browsers](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360020454099-What-browsers-are-supported-by-the-Web-Editor-)
  * Ensure JavaScript is enabled
* **Check the status tracker.** To see if there are any ongoing incidents, go to [status.arduino.cc](https://status.arduino.cc/) and check **Arduino Cloud > Editor**.
