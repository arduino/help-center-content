This error appears whenever the Create Agent is not installed or when the plug in needs to be updated or needs permissions.
If you click in the `Learn more` button, it will show some usual fixes.

Check if the agent is running. You should see the icon in the taskbar and its color should be black or green, _not_ grayed out. If it is grayed out, rick-click and select _Run Agent_. If you don't see the icon, open the agent by searching `Arduino Create`.

## For schools

If this is happening in school computers, it might be related to the app rights, please consult with the IT department to allow/install the Arduino Create Chrome app on all the devices. You may share the instructions available on [this tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/managed-install-of-arduino-create-for-education-chrome-app-6bf22a).

## General solution

* Make sure you are logged in to with the same e-mail account that has the app access.

* If this does not work, please uninstall and reinstall the agent, you can check this tutorials for that:
