When using the Arduino Cloud Free plan, the Arduino Web editor is limited to 200 seconds of compilation time per day. The time counted against the limit is reset every midnight (00:00) in your local time.

For unlimited compilation time you can [upgrade to any paid plan](https://www.arduino.cc/cloud/plans) or run the [classic Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) locally.
