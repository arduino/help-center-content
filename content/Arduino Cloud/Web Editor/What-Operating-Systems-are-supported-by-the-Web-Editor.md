title: "What Operating Systems are supported by the Web Editor?"
---

The Arduino Web Editor can be accessed through any web browser, allowing you to easily read, edit, and verify your code anywhere.

To enable uploading sketches to your board via USB, the **Arduino Create Agent** needs to be installed on your computer.

The Create Agent is fully supported on:

* [Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-arduino-web-editor-on-various-platforms-4b3e4a?f=1#toc-pick-your-platform--windows--mac-or-linux-3)
* [Chrome OS](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-arduino-web-editor-on-various-platforms-4b3e4a?f=1#toc-pick-your-platform--chrome-os-4)

Follow the steps in [the Arduino Create Agent installation guide](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome) to set it up.

> To install the agent on other systems, you will have to compile it yourself. You can find the agent's [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent). If you are compiling for Raspberry Pi, you can consult [this tutorial written by our developers](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/wiki/How-to-compile-on-Raspberry-Pi).
