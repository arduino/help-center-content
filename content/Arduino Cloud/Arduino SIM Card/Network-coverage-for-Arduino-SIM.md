## Check coverage for your country

Follow these steps to check if Arduino SIM has coverage in your country:

1. Open [Pelion's global coverage map](https://pelion.com/coverage/).

2. Scroll down and review the **2G, 3G, 4G, and LPWAN Coverage Map**.

3. Optionally, use the controls to filter by country, continent, or network type.

4. To use Arduino SIM, your country needs to have 2G or 3G coverage.

## About 2G and 3G network sunsets

2G and 3G have been sunsetted (decommissioned) in many countries, including the United States.

If 2G and 3G have been sunsetted in your country, Arduino SIM will not work.

To learn more, see [2G and 3G network sunsetting (Pelion)](https://pelion.com/2g-and-3g-network-sunsetting/).
