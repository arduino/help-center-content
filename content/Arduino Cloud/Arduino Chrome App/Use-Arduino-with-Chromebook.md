You can write and upload sketches on Chrome OS with the Web Editor in Arduino Cloud. The Web Editor has an extensive feature set similar to the desktop IDE. While many popular boards are compatible, you should check [the list of compatible boards here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014779899).

## New app beta

A new Arduino Cloud application for Chromebook is currently in development, and is available on Google Play as a beta release.

The regular Chrome app is still recommended for users that want a stable experience. But if you want to help support Arduino on Chromebook, we welcome you to try it out and share your feedback with us in the [forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/c/software/chrome-app/141).
