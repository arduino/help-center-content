> [!WARNING]
> **Arduino Cloud for Chromebook** has been removed from Google Play and is currently unavailable. We are actively working to resolve the issue. In the meantime, you can use the [Arduino Create for Education extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elmgohdonjdampbcgefphnlchgocpaij){.link-external}.

You can write and upload sketches on Chrome OS with the Cloud Editor in Arduino Cloud. The Cloud Editor has an extensive feature set similar to the desktop IDE. While many popular boards are compatible, you should check [the list of compatible boards here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014779899).

To use Arduino boards on Chromebook, you need to install the **Arduino Cloud for Chromebook** app. This app handles serial communication with the board and is replacing the previous Chrome Apps[^chrome-apps].

Follow these steps to install Arduino Cloud for Chromebook:

1. Open [Arduino Cloud for Chromebook (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.arduino.create_editor){.link-external}
2. Click the **Install** button on the page.
3. Choose the device and click **Install**.
4. Find the app in the **Launcher** to open it.
5. Sign in to your Arduino account

## Use the Cloud Editor on Chromebook

Follow these steps:

1. Open **Arduino Cloud for Chromebook** from the Launcher or go to [app.arduino.cc](https://app.arduino.cc/) in your browser.

1. If you're not already signed into your Arduino account, you'll be prompted to do so.

1. In the sidebar, select the **Sketches** tab.

1. Choose a sketch to open in the Cloud Editor:

   * **Create a new sketch:** Click on the Create button in the top-right corner and choose New Sketch.
   * **Open a saved sketch:** Click on a sketch you want to open.

1. Connect a [compatible board](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014779899#chromebook) to one of the USB ports on your Chromebook.

1. In the board selector menu, click on the **Detect Device** button.

1. Select the serial port for your board board you're using and click **Connect**. If you're unsure which serial port to use, try disconnecting and reconnecting your device. The serial port for your board will disappear and reappear in the list.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure your device is connected using a functional data USB cable and that one or more LEDs on the board are lit.
* Even if no board is detected, try clicking the Upload button to open the **Authorise USB connection** prompt.
* Make sure youâ€™re using the [Arduino Cloud for Chromebook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.arduino.create_editor) app, **not** the Arduino Create for Education Chrome app.
* Verify that the board is [compatible](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014779899-Boards-compatible-with-the-Web-Editor).
* If you're using either **Nano RP2040 Connect** or **UNO WiFi Rev2**, please follow the special [setup instructions](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014779899-Boards-compatible-with-the-Cloud-Editor#chromebook) for those boards.
* Ensure that the board is not [counterfeit](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360020652100-How-to-spot-a-counterfeit-Arduino).
