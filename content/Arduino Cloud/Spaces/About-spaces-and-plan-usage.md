## About Cloud plans{#about-cloud-plans}

* A Cloud plan is active in a particular space. Individual plans (Entry, Maker, and Maker Plus) increase the features of your Private Space, while School and Enterprise plans increase the features of a shared School or Enterprise space.
* When creating a new Thing or Trigger, they are added to the currently selected space and are counted against the space's plan usage. A Maker plan (or any individual plan) will not increase the limits of an Enterprise space, and an Enterprise plan will not increase the features of your Private space.

## Check which plans you can access{#check-plan-access}

If you're a member of a space that has an active, paid Cloud plan, the plan will appear on your **Plans page**.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [digital-store.arduino.cc/subscriptions/plans](https://digital-store.arduino.cc/subscriptions/plans)
2. Review the active plans:
   * Individual plans (Entry, Maker, and Maker Plus) increase the limits of your **Private Space**. If you're not subscribing to any paid Individual plan, the Free plan will be active.
   * Enterprise plans increase the limits of the shared Enterprise space displayed below the text "Enterprise Plan".
   * School plans increase the limits of the shared School space under "Plan details".
