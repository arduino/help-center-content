## Roles that can remove members

You can remove members from a space depending on your role:

* **Teachers** can remove **Students**
* **Admins** can remove any member.

## How removed members are affected

* Removed members keep their Arduino accounts
* Removed members will no longer have access to courses shared with the space.
* The removed member will keep their data, but will no longer benefit from additional features and limits provided by any **School plan** active with the space. Some features may be restricted if they exceed the limits of their personal plan. See [If you exceed plan limits after downgrading](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4401874212370-If-you-exceed-plan-limits-after-downgrading).
