title: "Roles and permissions in shared spaces"

Every member of a shared space is assigned a _role_ that specifies what type of actions are permitted for the member in that space.

Different roles are available depending on the type of space but generally, all members added to the shared space benefit from the Cloud plan associated with the space, while membership management (inviting and removing members, or changing a member's role) and shared plan management requires an elevated role.
