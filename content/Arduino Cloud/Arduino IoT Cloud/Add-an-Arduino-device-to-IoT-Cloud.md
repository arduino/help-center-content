## Troubleshooting

In case you have any issues configuring your device, you can try the following:

- Make sure you are using a Data USB cable
- Unplug and reconnect your device.
- If you're configuring a board, press the reset button twice in quick succession while the board is connected, to reset the bootloader.
- If possible, connect the device directly to a USB port on your computer, and not through a USB hub.
- If the Desktop IDE och Web Editor is running on your computer, try closing it.
