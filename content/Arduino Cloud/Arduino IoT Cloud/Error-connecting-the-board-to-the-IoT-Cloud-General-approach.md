In case you have any issues configuring your board, you can try the following:

* Make sure you are using a Data USB cable
* Try pressing the reset button on the board before starting the "Add device" routine.
* Try doing a quick double tap of the reset button to get the board to bootloader mode.
* If you are using a USB Hub for connection, try directly connecting the board to the computer.
* Make sure that there is no other IDE or Web editor open in your computer.
