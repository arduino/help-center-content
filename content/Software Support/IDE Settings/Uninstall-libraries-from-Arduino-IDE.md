Learn how to remove IDE libraries from your computer.

## Uninstall using your file manager

Removing the library files directly is the most reliable method that will work for versions of Arduino IDE and library types.

### Library Manager, "Add .ZIP Library", and manual installs

Most libraries are located in the Sketchbook library folder, including:

* Libraries installed with the Library Manager
* Libraries imported with _Sketch > Include library > Add .ZIP library..._
* Any other libraries manually moved into the folder

Follow these steps to remove these libraries.

1. [Open the Sketchbook](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4412950938514-Open-the-Sketchbook).
2. Go into the `libraries` subfolder.
3. Delete the folder for libraries you want to uninstall.
4. Restart Arduino IDE.

### Libraries bundled with board platforms

Some board platforms are packaged with libraries, that are saved within the [Arduino15 folder](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360018448279), inside the `Arduino15/packages/<vendor>/hardware/<board platform>/<version>/libraries` subfolder.

They are written specifically for the boards of that platform and are only accessible when one of those boards is selected in the _Tools > Board_ menu. They will be removed when [uninstalling the board platform](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4407225360018). Removing them is not recommended. If doing so, included examples may stop functioning. The libraries will be reinstalled if the package is updated by the Board Manager.

## Uninstall in Library manager (2.x only)

In **Arduino IDE 2.x**, libraries available in the Library Manager can also be uninstalled there.

1. In the menu bar, click on _Tools > Manage Libraries..._

2. Search for the library you want to uninstall.

3. Find the library in the search results, which are listed alphabetically.

4. Put your mouse cursor over the INSTALLED label and click UNINSTALL to uninstall the library.
