It is possible to compile programs for the Arduino using other build tools (e.g. Makefiles and/or AVR Studio). You'll need to configure these to link against the appropriate files in the Arduino core libraries. See the description of the Arduino [build process](https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduino/wikis/BuildProcess.wiki).
