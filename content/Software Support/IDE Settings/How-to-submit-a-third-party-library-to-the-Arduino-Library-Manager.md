The [Arduino Library Manager](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries#using-the-library-manager) is a feature of the Arduino IDE, which makes it easy for users to find, install, and update both official and 3rd party libraries.

Adding your library will make every release automatically available for installation in the Library Manager. Users can optionally display an update notification when a new library is available, and easily update it with just a few clicks.

To learn more and get started with submitting your library, see the documentation in the [library registry repository on GitHub](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry).
