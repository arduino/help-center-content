Third-party board platforms can be added to the Board Manager in Preferences.

## Configure additional Board Manager URLs

1. Open Preferences
   - **Windows/Linux:** `File > Preferences`
   - **macOS:** `Arduino > Preferences`

2. Click on the button to the right of the _Additional Boards Manager URLs_ text field.

   ![Preferences window.](img/IDE-preferences-URLs.png)

3. Paste or remove URLs in the window. There should be one URL for each line.

   > Removing URLs will not automatically remove the files from your computer. If you want to completely remove a package, uninstall it from the Boards Manager first.
