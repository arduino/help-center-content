title: "Manually update Arduino App Lab"
---

Normally, Arduino App Lab is automatically updated when a new version is released. If you need to manually update App Lab, you can download and install the latest version from the Arduino website.

---

Follow these steps:

1. Open the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#app-lab-section).
1. Find the **Arduino App Lab** section—not _Arduino IDE_ or _Arduino Lab for MicroPython_.
1. Confirm that the download option for your operating system is selected and click **Download**.
1. Wait for the download to finish.
1. Install the application:
   - **Windows:** Run the `.exe` file from your Downloads folder and follow the prompts provided by the installer.
   - **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file from your Downloads folder. Drag and drop Arduino App Lab into your Applications folder.
   - **Linux:** Extract the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive. Optionally, move the folder to your Application folder, or wherever you had previously installed App Lab.
1. If prompted, allow the installation to overwrite the old version of the application.

After that, you will have the latest version of Arduino App Lab installed on your computer.
