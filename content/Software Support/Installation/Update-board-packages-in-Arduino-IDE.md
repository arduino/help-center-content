## Update using the "Updates are available" prompt

Arduino IDE automatically checks for board package updates each time you start the application.

![Prompt with the text "Updates are available for some of your boards" and the options "Later", "Install Manually", and "Install All".](img/updates-available.png)

If an update is available, a notification will be displayed in the corner with these options:

- _Later._ Close the prompt without updating.
- _Install Manually._ View updatable board packages in the Board Manager.
- _Install All._ Install all updates automatically.

You can also manually trigger the "Updates are available" prompt:

1. Use one of these keyboard shortcuts to open the Command Palette:

   - Press `Ctrl`+ `Shift` + `P` (Windows/Linux) / `âŒ˜` + `Shift` + `P` (macOS)

   - Press `F1`.

2. Type "Update", and select **Check for Arduino Updates** (this command also checks for library updates).

3. If any of your installed board packages can be updated, the "Updates are available" prompt will appear.

## Update boards using the Board Manager

Follow these steps to update board packages in the Board Manager:

1. Open the ![Boards Manager icon](img/symbol_board.png) **Board Manager** from the sidebar, or select Tools > Board > Boards Manager in the menu bar.

2. Set the **Type** filter to "Updatable" to view board packages that can be updated. <!-- You can also search for any board by typing in the text field. -->

3. The currently installed version for each board package is displayed under the board name.

   Confirm the selected version to install (the latest is selected by default) and click **Update** to install it.
