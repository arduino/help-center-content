title: "Supported versions of Arduino IDE"
---

Arduino IDE 2 was fully released in September 2022, and is the actively developed and recommended desktop environment for Arduino. While IDE 2 was still in development, Arduino also maintained a version of IDE 1, so users could choose between the familiar experience of the classic IDE and the modern features of IDE 2.

Arduino IDE 1.8.19 remains available as the final version of the classic IDE, but it only receives critical security fixes. For the best experience, security, and support, Arduino encourages all users to move to the latest version of Arduino IDE 2.

## Arduino IDE 1.8.19 (Legacy)

Arduino IDE 1.8.19 (sometimes referred to as the "Legacy IDE" or "Java IDE") is the last version of Arduino IDE 1. Arduino maintains it only for high-severity security fixes. While existing projects may still compile and upload in this environment, you should migrate to IDE 2 to benefit from continued support, stability, and future functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the best experience, use the most recent version of Arduino IDE 2 instead. It gives you the newest features, ongoing support, and critical security protections, creating a reliable environment for all Arduino projects.

## Other versions of Arduino IDE

All other versions of Arduino IDE are unsupported and are not available for download on the official software page. Using these versions can create compatibility problems with current hardware and may expose you to security risks. For the best experience, use the most recent version of Arduino IDE 2.
