When uploading a sketch to your board you may get an error from the **avrdude** utility:

## General troubleshooting checklist

Most errors can be solved by following these steps. After each step, try uploading your sketch again.

1. Make sure you have [selected the right board and port](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE) correct board under _Tools > Board_ and  _Tools > Port_.

   * For instructions, see [Select board and port in Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE)

   * If your board is missing, see [If your board does not appear in the port menu](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4412955149586-If-your-board-does-not-appear-in-the-port-menu)

2. Close other instances of Arduino IDE, serial monitors, and other software that may be blocking the port. If this doesn't work, try restarting your computer.

3. Reset your board by pressing the RESET button (a white or blue push button).

4. Check port and cable connections:

   * Try disconnecting and reconnecting the board to the computer, and confirm that the power LED (often labeled "ON") is lit.

   * If possible, connect the board directly to a USB port. Avoid using a USB hub if possible, or try a different hub.

   * Make sure you are using a data transfer USB cable (charge-only cables will not work). Try connecting your board with a different cable, or testing your cable with a different device.

   * Remove any unneeded USB devices that may be using the ports.

5. Remove any connections to digital pins **0(RX)** and **1(TX)**. Anything connected to these pins can interfere with the upload transfer.

1. Make sure you have [selected the right board and port](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE) correct board under _Tools > Board_ and  _Tools > Port_.

   * For instructions, see [Select board and port in Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE)

   * If your board is missing, see [If your board does not appear in the port menu](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4412955149586-If-your-board-does-not-appear-in-the-port-menu)

2. If using the classic Nano, try selecting a different processor in _Tools > Processor_.

3. For some boards, a [loopback test](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360020366520-How-to-do-a-loopback-test) can be performed, which will rule out problems with the serial chip. It can be done with the following boards:

   * Arduino UNO (classic)
   * Arduino UNO Rev3
   * Arduino UNO Rev3 SMD
   * Arduino Mega (classic)
   * Arduino Mega2560 Rev3
   * Arduino Mega ADK Rev3
   * Arduino Nano (classic)

   If the loopback test passes, or if you can't do a loopback test, reprogramming the bootloader may resolve the issue. See [Burn the bootloader on UNO, Mega, and classic Nano using another Arduino](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4841602539164-Burn-the-bootloader-on-UNO-Mega-and-classic-Nano-using-another-Arduino) or look for [other articles in the Help Center](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=bootloader).

Problem uploading to board. See http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting#upload for suggestions.
```

This error can happen if the board on the selected port has been disconnected from the computer, or reassigned to a different port.

1. Make sure the correct port is selected in _Tools > Port_.

   * For step-by-step instructions, see [Select board and port in Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE).
   * If you can't find the port, see [If your board does not appear in the port menu](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4412955149586-If-your-board-does-not-appear-in-the-port-menu).

2. If using the classic Nano, try selecting a different processor in _Tools > Processor_.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, you can [manually set a port for the board](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016420140#set-COM-port) to stop it from being reassigned.
