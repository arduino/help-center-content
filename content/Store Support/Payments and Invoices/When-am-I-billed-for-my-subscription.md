The billing date of a subscription is determined by:

* The date the subscription was created
* The billing interval (monthly or yearly)

The first charge applies when you sign up for the plan. The following charge occurs at the end of each billing cycle, on the same day of the month.

* If you sign up for a monthly subscription on the 2nd, you will be billed on the 2nd every month.
* If you sign up for a yearly subscription on June 14th, you will be billed on June 14th each year.
