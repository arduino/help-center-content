Yes, the data is transmitted TLS-encrypted.

For payments with Visa and Mastercard only TLS transactions (Transport Layer Security) are accepted. After verifying that the card is included in the TSL system, the system will contact the card-issuing bank to enable the buyer to authorize the purchase. When the bank confirms the authenticity, the payment will be charged to the card. Otherwise the order will be canceled.
