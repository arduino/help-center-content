### How to make a Tax-Exempt order

1. Reach out to our [customer service](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us) and provide your tax-exempt documentation.

1. Our team will verify your tax-exempt status.

1. Once verified, we will update your account to reflect your tax-exempt status.

1. After your account is updated, you can make purchases without any taxes applied.
