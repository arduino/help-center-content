After an order is placed in the Arduino Store, the package is picked up and delivered by a 3rd party carrier. Once the goods have been shipped, you will receive a shipping confirmation email, that includes a tracking number and information about the shipping method selected. Account users can also see a summary of the orders in the [account section](https://store.arduino.cc/account) of the Arduino Store.

## Delivery time

Delivery time changes depending on the selected carrier and destination country as indicated in the checkout phase. Carrier delivery time does not include the order processing period. Arduino Srl and Arduino LLC cannot be held responsible for the carrier's late deliveries. See the [available shipping methods](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/5340856700188) and their estimated delivery times.

### Order processing time

#### Europe and Africa

All orders addressed to Europe and Africa are shipped from Arduino's EU warehouse located in Parma (Italy). Note that the warehouse is closed on the weekends.

* Orders entered before 11 AM CET (GMT+1) Mon-Fri ship the same day.
* Orders entered after 11 AM CET (GMT+1) Mon-Fri ship the next business day.

#### Americas, Asia, and Oceania

All orders addressed to Americas, Asia and Oceania are shipped from Arduino's US warehouse located in Lakewood, NJ (USA). Note that the warehouse is closed on the weekends.

* Orders entered before 2 PM ET (GMT-5) Mon-Thu will be shipped on the same day.
* Orders entered before 12 PM ET (GMT-5) Fri will be shipped on the same day.
* Orders entered after 12 PM ET (GMT-5) Fri will be shipped on the next business day.

## Track an order

<a id="deliveries-by-the-local-post"></a>

### Deliveries by the local post

For orders addressed to America, Asia, and Oceania, the [FedEx Ground® Economy](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/ground/economy.html), [DHL Parcel International Standard](https://www.dhl.com/us-en/home/ecommerce-solutions/shipping-services.html), and [Asendia](https://www.asendia.com/) shipping methods utilize the local postal service for the final delivery. These shipping methods might have longer delivery times (up to a month for orders outside the USA) and are more difficult to track.

The tracking number for the local delivery can be different:

    <td><img src="https://content.arduino.cc/assets/dhl-local-tracking-number.png" alt="DHL tracking page linking to Australia Post"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

For the FedEx Ground® Economy shipping method, the tracking number provided works in both FedEx's and USPS’s tracking systems.

<a id="possible-fees"></a>

## Possible additional fees charged by the carrier

Orders shipped to territories outside the USA and EU may be subject to local import taxes (VAT and Duties), and local courier companies may charge a service fee in addition to the original shipping costs.

Also, your carrier might request the payment of additional fees due to the customs clearance process performed at the parcel's destination country. The customs fees are regulated by the local authorities in the destination country. That fact makes it impossible to predict if you will be charged customs fees when ordering a product from the Arduino store. Ordered parcels will be returned to the sender if this fee is not paid to the carrier.

>Even though it is impossible to predict if additional fees will occur, in some cases, albeit slower, deliveries made by the local postal services are less likely to be charged customs fees.

<a id="cancel-or-modify-an-order"></a>

## Cancel or modify an order

After an order is placed it is processed and sent to a carrier. If the order information clears and the items are in stock, it is impossible to change the order. This includes adding or removing items, changing the shipping information, or cancelling the order.

If you want to return your order and receive a refund you can reject to receive the delivery from the shipping carrier. The shipment will be returned free of charge, and we will process your refund. Please [contact us](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/) for additional questions.
