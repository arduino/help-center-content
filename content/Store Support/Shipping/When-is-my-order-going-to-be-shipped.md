title: "When is my order going to be shipped?"

It is important to note that our warehouses are closed on the weekends.
At the checkout, the exact delivery date does not include the extra processing day, which you need to count with as not all orders can be processed and shipped out on the same day they have been placed.

You can see the our order processing method:
