Unfortunately, there are some cases when, even if the tracking number shows that the parcel has been delivered, it has not been delivered to the hands of the customer. This mostly happens with the parcels, where a signature is not required.

If this happened to you, please check the following before you make contact with Arduino Customer Support:

* Check with other people living in your same address, or perhaps a neighbor, to make sure that nobody picked up your package.
* Check around the entrance(s) of your residence for the package, particularly on back porches, bushes, garages, grills, or other places that might protect your package from theft or weather.

> Note that drivers may also use plastic bags to protect your package from the weather.

If you have tried all this and your parcel has still not been found, you can
make contact with Arduino Customer Support to find a solution for your problem.
