FedEx Smartpost is an available shipping method for our US store.
You can see this option only for orders inside the United States.

Although it is one of our cheapest shipping methods, it is important to know, that delivery with this option takes longer than usual because based on the average daily shipping volume, FedEx SmartPost offers a customized solution: They pick up (or accept drop shipments), provide line haul and deliver the packages to a USPS facility for final delivery by a postal carrier.

In this case, the tracking number works both in FedEx’s and USPS’s system.

Please note that this option does not have any Proof of the Delivery.
