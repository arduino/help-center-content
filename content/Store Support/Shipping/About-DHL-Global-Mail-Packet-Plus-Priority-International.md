title: "About DHL Global Mail Packet Plus Priority International"
---

DHL Global Mail Packet Plus Priority International is an available shipping method for our US store. You can see this option for most of the orders inside and outside the United States.

Also, it is important to know that this is not simply the cheapest shipping option, but the longest delivery method too, as it is a normal postal service delivered by the local post.

As for every postal service, these parcels are hard to be tracked and located. In this case, for shipments outside the U.S., delivery can take about one month and we are not able to speed it up.

Please, also notice that some countries create a local tracking number for these shipments. This can be found on the right column of the DHL page of your original, international tracking number and it starts to work as soon as the package arrives in the destination country.
