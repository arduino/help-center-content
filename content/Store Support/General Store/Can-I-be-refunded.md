## Refunds for physical products

From the date of the customer’s receipt of merchandise, you have 30 days to contact [Arduino customer support](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/) and inform that you want to return any or all products from your order. After our colleagues replied, you have 14 days to return your product (and any promotional merchandise supplied with it). If you have purchased the product from somewhere other than the Arduino Store, please contact that reseller.

For all returns, please use the pre-paid shipping label and transport documents sent by us. Any return made by a customer without a written return authorization from Arduino will be considered an unauthorized return and will not be subject to a refund or credit by Arduino. The customer assumes all shipping and handling charges for any unauthorized return.

If a product consists of several parts, you must return all parts of the product in order to obtain a refund.
Products must be received by Arduino in a “resalable condition”. “Resalable condition” means that the product has no sign of use, wear and tear, cosmetic damage, or any other damage. You must keep the original packaging and use it to repack the product to be returned.

See the [Seller Terms](https://store.arduino.cc/pages/transparency) for complete return conditions.
