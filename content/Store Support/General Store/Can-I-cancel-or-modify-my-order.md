title: "Can I cancel or modify my order?"
---

When an order is placed it will quickly be processed and sent to our logistics providers. If the order information clears and the items are in stock, there is usually no time for us to change the order in any way. This includes adding or removing items, changing the shipping information, or canceling the order.

If you want to return your order and receive a refund, you can reject to receive the delivery from the shipping carrier. The shipment will be returned free of charge, and we will process your refund. Please [contact us](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/) for additional questions.
