The Arduino online store manages two different currencies depending on your [selected location](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/15529764047516).

In case you have selected:

* America/Asia/Oceania, the prices displayed in the online store are in USD (American dollars).
* Europe/Africa, the prices displayed in the online store are in Euros.
