The Nano 33 BLE Sense has multiple sensors available on it and requires individual libraries to activate and test each sensor. Below you can see the different sensors available on the board and the associated libraries for each sensors.

* Temperature and Humidity - [ArduinoHTS221](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoHTS221)
* Pressure - [ArduinoLPS22HB](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLPS22HB)
* Gesture (color, illumination and proximity)- [ArduinoAPDS9960](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoAPDS9960)
* IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer) - [ArduinoLSM9DS1](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLSM9DS1)

If you would like to make a quick test of all the sensors at once you can use [this](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/arduino_support/68cca5d0-4f1b-45ea-b43d-f22b759555fa/preview) sketch to check if all the sensors are being initialised.
