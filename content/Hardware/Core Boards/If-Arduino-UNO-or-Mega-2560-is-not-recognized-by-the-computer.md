title: "If Arduino UNO or Mega 2560 is not recognized by the computer"
---

Missing or corrupted **USB-to-Serial** firmware can cause UNO (except WiFi Rev2) and Mega boards to be recognized as any of the following:

- Unknown Device
- Composite Device
- ATmega16u2 DFU
- Atmega8U2 DFU

Resolve the issue by [flashing the USB-to-Serial firmware in DFU mode](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4408887452434-Flash-USB-to-serial-firmware-in-DFU-mode).
