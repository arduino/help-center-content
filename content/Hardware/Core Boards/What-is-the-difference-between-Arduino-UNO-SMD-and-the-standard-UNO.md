title: "What is the difference between Arduino UNO SMD and the standard UNO"
---

If you have noticed two different types of Arduino UNO available in our store and you wonder what is the difference between those two, keep reading to find out!

There are two versions of Arduino UNO currently available:

* Arduino UNO Rev3
* Arduino UNO SMD

The difference between the two is just physical and lays on the AVR chip package used. In the UNO SMD (Surface Mounted Device) the microprocessor chip (ATmega328) is integrated and soldered onto the board; while in the standard UNO, the ATmega328 is DIP (Dual In-line Packaged), which means that the microprocessor chip can easily be removed and replace if necessary. This is very convenient if the chip gets damaged and needs to be replace or the user wishes to move the chip to a standalone project.
