The MKR IoT Carrier is equipped with a battery holder that allows us to have portable projects. If you want to power your project with a battery, you will need one **18650 Li-Ion 3.7V battery**, which can be purchased from most electronic vendors.

## What youâ€™ll need

* Explore IoT Kit
  * MKR IoT Carrier
  * Arduino MKR board (such as the MKR WiFi 1010)
  * Battery connection cable (black and red wires)
* 18650 3.7V Li-ion battery

## Steps

1. Mount the board on top of the MKR IoT Carrier, making sure the pin names line up.
2. Connect the battery connection cable between the board and the carrier.
3. Place the battery in the holder with the polarity matching that of the board.
