In this article, we will go through a step-by-step process on how to get the latest Wi-Fi firmware on your Portenta H7 board. Before updating the WiFi firmware, make sure the bootloader is up-to-date. You can update the bootloader by following the Portenta documentation page [here](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/tutorials/portenta-h7/por-ard-bl).

## Requirements

1. Arduino Portenta H7
2. USB-C Cable
3. Latest Arduino IDE (1.8 or 2.0)
4. Latest Bootloader on the board

## Steps

1. Make sure that the board is properly connected to your computer using the USB C cable.

2. Select the board and port number of the board under the tools options of the IDE.
