title: "Can I detach the Portenta H7 from the Portenta Machine Control?"
---

Arduino Portenta Machine Control (PMC) is an industrial control unit powered by an Arduino Portenta H7 microcontroller included inside the enclosure.

However, the PMC is sold as a _whole product_ and the Portenta H7 included has not been configured to work as stand-alone device. Furthermore, detaching the Portenta H7 board may result in voidance of warranty and declined support.
