The Portenta H7 is specially designed for high performance in industrial environments. While the hardware is highly customizable, we provide three ready-made solutions:

* **Portenta H7:** The full version. Program using high-level languages and AI while performing low-latency operations on its customizable hardware.
* **Portenta H7 Lite:** A cost-optimized solution, ideal for complex environments where radio communication is not suitable or possible. Designed for developers who want to leverage the same computational power of the Portenta H7, but do not need wireless connectivity, high-resolution video interface, and additional security features.
* **Portenta H7 Lite Connected:** Fills the gap between the full and Lite variants by integrating wireless connectivity, hitting another sweet spot for industrial-strength solutions.
