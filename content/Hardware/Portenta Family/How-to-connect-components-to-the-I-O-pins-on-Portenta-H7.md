title: "How to connect components to the I/O pins on Portenta H7"
---

Portenta H7 does not come with soldered pin headers therefore connecting additional components can be challenging if you are a beginner level user. There are different options to connect components directly to Portenta's I/O pins:

* Solder compatible headers yourself. Compatible headers are 14-pin female connectors with 2.54 mm pitch (MKR form factor). [Available in Arduino Store.](https://store.arduino.cc/female-headers-14-ways-arduino-mkr1000-printed)
* Use the [Arduino Portenta Breakout board](https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-breakout) to access the high-density pins, all interfaces, and the main I/O pins
* Access all high density pins with a [DF40C-80DP-0.4V(51) connector](https://www.hirose.com/product/p/CL0684-4001-8-51) (not included).
* Attach your components directly into the circle pins. It is possible to insert jumper wires into the holes and bend them over to secure the connection. It is not the most reliable way to connect components but it is convenient for quick tests or very simple designs.
