---

The library that has been developed for the Portenta Machine Control can be found in Arduino IDE Library Manager. To install it simply open Arduino IDE and click on `Tools > Manage Libraries`. Then search for "Arduino_MachineControl" and click on the install button.

The library includes several example sketches that will become available in the examples section of Arduino IDE once the library is added. The examples included cover the main functionalities of the Machine Control such as analog input/output, encoders, and digital input/outputs. The examples can be found from Arduino IDE menu 'File > Examples > Arduino_MachineControl'.

Updating Mbed Core in the Boards Manager (`Tools > Board: > Boards Manager...`) is recommended before running any library example.
