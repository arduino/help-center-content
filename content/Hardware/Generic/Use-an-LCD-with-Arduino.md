title: "Use an LCD with Arduino"

You can easily connect a liquid crystal display (LCD) with an Arduino to display data.

The [LiquidCrystal library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/liquidcrystal/) allows you to control LCD displays based on the Hitachi HD44780 chipset (which is found on most text-based LCDs).

See [this guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/lcd-displays) on how to wire an LCD to an Arduino board and use the LiquidCrystal library
