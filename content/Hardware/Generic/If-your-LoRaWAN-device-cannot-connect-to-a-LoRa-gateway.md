title: "If your LoRaWAN速 device cannot connect to a LoRa速 gateway"
---

Check the following if you experience issues connecting your LoRaWAN device to a LoRa速 Gateway.

* Double-check your **APP EUI** and **APP KEY** from your device section of the TTN application. Make sure the digits are inserted in the right format and there are no spaces at the beginning or end of the sequence.
* Check that you have LoRaWAN速 coverage in your area using [this map](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map). Navigate to your region to see all available gateways and their specifications. The typical maximum range for a reliable connection is 10 km.
* If you are within range but the connection fails, check the specifications of the selected gateway. Gateways placed indoors or at low altitude can decrease the range considerably. The same applies to the antenna of your device: try moving it to a window to avoid obstructing the signal.
* Ensure that the antenna is securely connected and it complies to specifications. Learn more about compatible antennas for LoRaWAN devices [here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4402394619410-What-antennas-can-I-use-with-Portenta-Vision-Shield-LoRa-).
