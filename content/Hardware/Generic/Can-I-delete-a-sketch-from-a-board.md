title: "Can I delete a sketch from a board?"
---

Uploading any sketch will delete any previous sketch stored in the memory. A sketch must always include the functions `setup()` and `loop()`, but they can be left empty in this case.

Just copy and paste the code below or load the example in the Arduino IDE: `File > Examples > Basics > BareMinimum`. Read more about the example [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/BareMinimum).

```arduino
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
