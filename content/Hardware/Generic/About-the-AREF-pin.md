The **AREF (Analog Reference) pin** can be used to provide an external **reference voltage** for the analog-to-digital conversion of inputs to the analog pins. The reference voltage essentially specifies the value for the top of the input range, and consequently each discrete step in the converted output.

> **Note:**

> When reading voltage on the analog pins (e.g. **A0**, **A1**, etc.) the analog signal needs to be converted into a digital signal. This is done by a digital-to-analog converter (ADC). Arduino boards typically use a 10-bit ADC, resulting in 1024 (2^10) discrete levels.

> For example, if we want to measure voltages with a maximum range of 3.3 V, we would feed a nice smooth 3.3 V into the AREF pin â€“ perhaps from a voltage regulator IC. Then the each step of a 10-bit analog-to-digital conversion (to would represent 3.22 mV.

Not all boards have an enabled AREF pin, and the function on those that do can vary:
