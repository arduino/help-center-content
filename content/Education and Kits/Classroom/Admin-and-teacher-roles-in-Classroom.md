title: "Admin and teacher roles in Classroom"
---

The *Educators* section of a classroom has two roles: *Admin* and *Teacher*.

Users assigned with the *Teacher* role can access all the classroom courses, see teacher's content, manage students access to the classroom and invite other Teachers.

Users assigned with the *Admin* role have access to all *Teacher* features. Admins can also manage the classroom settings, change educator roles, invite or remove Teachers, and invite or remove other Admins (except the classroom owner).
