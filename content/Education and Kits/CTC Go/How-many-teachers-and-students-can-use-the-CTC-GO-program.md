title: "How many teachers and students can use the CTC GO! program?"
---

There is no limitation on the number of teachers and students enrolled in the online platform. But since the boards and components included in the toolbox accommodate up to 24 students, we recommend this as the maximum number of students per toolbox for optimal use. Please note that it is possible to add or remove students and teachers from the online platform at any time.
