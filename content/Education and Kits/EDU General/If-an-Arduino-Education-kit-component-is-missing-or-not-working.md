In this article, you can find a quick troubleshooting guide to help you when a board or component is not working or when the projects are not coming along as expected.

Most educational kits include a *Troubleshooting* or *Not Working* section on each stage of their projects. Start by referring to that section, and make sure that you have not missed any details during the completion of the project.

## Broken or missing hardware

1. If having issues with a component, try another of the same type and check if the problem persists.

2. If components are broken or missing upon receiving your shipment, please [contact us](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/).

3. To purchase spare parts, [visit the Arduino Store](https://store.arduino.cc/spare-parts).

## Issues with an Arduino board

1. Change the pin used on the board.

2. Check that you are using the [last IDE version](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and that the drivers on the computer are updated.

3. Connect the board to a different port, reopen the IDE and check if the problem persists.

4. Try a new USB cable making sure it is a DATA USB one.

5. Connect the board to a different computer and check if the problem persists.
