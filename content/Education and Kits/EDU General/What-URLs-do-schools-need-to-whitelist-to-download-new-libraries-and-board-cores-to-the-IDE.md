title: "What URLs do schools need to whitelist, to download new libraries and board cores to the IDE?"
---

Depending on the system's security, you might need to add some URLs or websites to the security "whitelist" (a list of URLs that are safe to access by installed programs).

In the IDE's case, in order to be able to download and install both libraries and board cores, your system will need to have `downloads.arduino.cc` whitelisted.
