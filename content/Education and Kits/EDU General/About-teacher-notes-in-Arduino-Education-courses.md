Teacher notes are supplementary materials available with many Arduino Education products and courses. They are designed to assist educators in the classroom by providing valuable guidance, lesson plans, and project solutions.

## Accessing teacher notes

To enable teacher notes, you must meet at least one of the following requirements:

- **Be a teacher or admin** in a shared space that has an active Education plan.
- **Have an individual, paid Arduino Cloud plan.** Users with the individual Maker plan can also access the notes.
- **Have previously registered a kit** that includes teacher notes, before kit registration was discontinued.

If you have access to teacher notes, you will see a toggle switch when viewing the course. Use it to enable or disable the teacher notes. This setting only affects your account.
