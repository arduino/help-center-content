## Use Processing in your browser

Processing is a programming language with multiple possibilities, thanks to the effort of its community. To display your projects to this community we suggest two ways to upload and share your projects.

These tools could also help you create a collaborative environment to write your code in.

- [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/){.link-external}

   OpenProcessing is an open gallery for your projects, just create an account and you can upload and execute your Processing sketches in the browser.

   This website has the option to render your sketch using [p5js](https://p5js.org/) or [processingJS](http://processingjs.org/). These two modes have some different syntaxes however the processingJS mode uses the same syntax as the one you use in the Processing IDE.

- [SketchPad](https://sketchpad.cc/){.link-external}

  SketchPad will help you create a collaborative environment to write code between multiple users by just sharing the URL of the project. It also allows to share code and embed it in websites.

  An interesting feature is that you can keep track of your code's versions, useful when you want to go back to any of the past interactions.

## Can I use processing in Chromebooks?

Yes, you can use Processing on Chromebooks that support Linux on ChromeOS. Most Chromebooks released after 2019, and some earlier models, allow this. Follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OteeRNblwxU) for instructions on how to install Processing on your Chromebook.

To check if your Chromebook supports Linux, visit [ChromeOS Systems Supporting Linux](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux/).

If you're using a Chromebook from a school or workplace, Linux may be disabled. In that case, ask [your administrator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6208960?sjid=7209928928643098082-EU) for help.

If you canâ€™t install Processing, you can still code Processing or p5.js projects online. See [Use Processing in your browser](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360017098499).

## Get started with Processing in CTC 101

When you've [registered your kit](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4407393580818-Register-an-Arduino-Education-Kit), you can learn about how to install and use Processing in the CTC 101 kit resources:

1. Go to [ctc101.arduino.cc/resources](https://ctc101.arduino.cc/resources).
2. Type "Processing" in the search field.
3. Check these resources:
   - Install Processing and examples
   - Processing Android Mode examples
   - Processing Android mode installation
   - Processing exercises
   - Processing in the browser
   - Processing serial port

## How to work with the projects that use Processing-Arduino communication in Chromebook

When using Chromebooks, not being able to install programs in the laptop means that it is not possible for the Arduino Cloud Editor's Serial port to communicate with the processing code.

The 4 projects in CTC 101 that uses communication between Processing and Arduino, and some workarounds for them are:

- Module 3 - Cookie monster: The project can be done without Processing, but no photos can be captured.

- Module 4 - Camera bot: The project can be done without Processing, but no photos can be captured.

- Module 5:

  - Asteroid Attack: can be focused on developing a game. Instead of controlling the game with the Arduino 101 board, it can be controlled using the keyboard and mouse.

  - Nova beam: Use the board only. A colored LED and a rolled paper sheet can be used for the beam.

## What programming language does Processing use?

Processing is the name both for the IDE and the language used.

---

## Where are the Processing examples?

You can find and download all the code for the processing programs [here](https://github.com/arduino/CTC-Processing/tree/master/en).

---

## Where are the pictures for the Processing projects?

For the Post-it clock, you can find the pictures in the data folder inside each one of the steps in [here](https://github.com/arduino/CTC-Processing/tree/master/en/_02_PostIt_Clock). For the Catch the apple game, you can find the pictures [here](https://github.com/arduino/CTC-Processing/tree/master/en/_03_Catch_The_Apple).
