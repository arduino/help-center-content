These examples are not included by default, to have easy access to them in the list we have to include the education shield libraries. In order to do this, go to the Libraries tab, click in Library manager and search for `education` or `educationShield`, then click on the star to make it to select it as a favorite. If you want to include also the examples for the capacitive sensor, search and favorite `capacitiveSensor`. From now on, the examples will be available from the Examples tab in their corresponding folders.
