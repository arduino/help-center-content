## Try this first

- Check the course material, particularly the "Getting started" chapters or lessons, or those specific a project you're doing.
- Check any error messages you are getting for additional information.
- Test if specific components in the Arduino Engineering Kit Rev2 are functioning correctly or if they are faulty. See [AEK R2: functional test for battery, servo motor, and DC motor](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/10972564241948-AEK-R2-functional-test-for-battery-servo-motor-and-DC-motor) for more information.
