title: "Using the included MATLAB and Simulink licenses"
---

The Arduino Engineering Kit includes a free one-year non-transferable individual license for MATLAB and Simulink.

If you wish to continue using MATLAB and Simulink after the end of the trial period or extend your current license, please visit [mathworks.com/store](https://se.mathworks.com/store) to find the available options.

Should the included license not be sufficient for your project's needs, please contact [Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/company/aboutus/contact_us/arduino_engineering_kit.html) and seek guidance determining the best solution.
