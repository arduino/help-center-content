The bolts included in the starter kit are usually packed in the **electronics components box** that comes inside the kit. You will get 3 bolts and 3 nuts inside the kit. In case you want the exact specification if you like to buy that separately or if you didnâ€™t find that in the box, these are the numbers:

* Bolts: M3*12mm</li>
* Nut: M3</li>
