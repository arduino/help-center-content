title: "Find the temperature sensor in your Arduino Starter Kit"

A temperature sensor will change its voltage output depending on the temperature of the
component. Learn how to find the sensor in your kit.

The temperature sensor included in the Starter Kit looks like this:

Here are some tips to help tell it apart from other components:

* All three pins on the temperature sensor are straight, unlike the included transistors, which have a bend in the two outer pins.
* Look for the label "TMP" or "MCP9700AE" on the flat side of the temperature sensor. You may need a flashlight to see the text clearly.
