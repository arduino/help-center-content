Different servo manufacturers may have different ways to order the wires to the connectors. The key are always the wire colors:

* red = VCC
* black = GND
* other = signal.

The servo represented in the projects book graphics may not look exactly the same as the one in your Arduino Starter Kit, but you can assume that the black wire is GND, the red wire is 5V and the last one is the PWM signal.
