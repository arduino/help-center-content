Most Arduino Education kits do not require activation codes, and all online learning content can be found by visiting [courses.arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/education/courses/). However, [some kits](#kits) require registration with an activation code for full course access.

In this article:

* [Kits that require registration](#kits)
* [Find the activation code](#find-code)

## Kits that require registration {#kits}

The following Arduino Education kits require registration to have full access to their courses:

* Arduino Braccio ++
* Arduino CTC GO! Core Module
* Arduino CTC GO! Motions Expansion Pack
* Arduino Education Starter Kit
* Arduino Engineering Kit Rev2
* Arduino Explore IoT Kit
* Arduino Greenhouse Kit
* Arduino Student Kit

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The **Arduino CTC 101 Program Full** and the **Arduino Engineering Kit** include activation codes but no longer require registration since their courses are now free.
> * The **Arduino Explore IoT Kit Rev2** includes two demo lessons. To access the full course, you need a [Cloud School Plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans/).
> * The **Arduino Opl√† IoT Kit** includes a code for 12 free months of the [Cloud Maker Plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans/). While the online content is free, some projects require a premium Cloud plan to support their templates.

## Find the activation code {#find-code}

[If your kit includes an activation code](#kits), this code will be visible when the box is opened, and it will be placed on the inside of the lid or on the cardboard. If your activation code is missing, please [contact us](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/).
