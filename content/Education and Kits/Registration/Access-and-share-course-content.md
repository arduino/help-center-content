## Unlock course access

You can gain access to courses in different ways:

* Any paid Cloud plan will grant access to **all courses**:
  * **Individual plans (Entry, Maker, Maker Plus):** When you sign up for an individual Cloud plan, you can access all courses when viewing your personal space (My Cloud).
  * **School Plan:** When a shared space is upgraded with a School plan, all members of that space can access all courses when viewing that space.
* Some kits include a **registration code**. Registering the kit unlocks permanent access to the course for that kit, and does not require an active Cloud plan. You can keep the course inside your personal space, or share it with a shared space for education, which lets all members of that space access the course.
* Additionally, some content (like the **Opl√† IoT Kit** course) may be available for free.
