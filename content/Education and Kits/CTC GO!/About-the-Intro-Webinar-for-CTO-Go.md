The Intro Webinar is an introduction to the CTC GO! program, where an Arduino Education expert will assist you in getting started and guide you through setting up your product. It is not mandatory but recommended since it is an excellent opportunity to ask questions about the program before going through the content.

To schedule your Intro Webinar, please use the [booking page](https://ctc-go-intro.youcanbook.me/).
