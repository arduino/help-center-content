## Compatible boards

The Science Journal can be used with the following boards:

* Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 (with the Science Carrier, or Science Carrier Rev2)
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2
* Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect (by itself, or with the Science Carrier R3)

> [!NOTE]
> The MKR WiFi 1010 needs to be connected using the Science Carrier, which is only available in the [Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-science-kit-physics-lab).

> [!NOTE]
> If your board came with a Science Kit, it will have the the required firmware out-of-the-box. If you're using a board not included in a Science Kit, an individually bought board replacement, or have flashed the board with different firmware, see [Upload the Science Journal firmware](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4408029337746-Upload-the-Science-Journal-firmware).

## Troubleshooting

* If you're using a Science Carrier, make sure the board is properly connected to it and that the pins (e.g. A1, A2) line up.
* Make sure your board has the correct firmware. See [Upload the Science Journal firmware](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4408029337746-Upload-the-Science-Journal-firmware) for more information.
