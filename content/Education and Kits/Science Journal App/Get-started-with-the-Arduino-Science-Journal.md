## Get the app

The Arduino Science Journal app can be downloaded from the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android).

* [Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arduino-science-journal/id1518014927)
* [Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.arduino.sciencejournal)

Read [Setting up Experiments](https://science-journal.arduino.cc/sj/module/getting-started-1/lesson/setting-up-experiments) for instructions on how to setup the app on an Android or iOS device.

## Compatible boards

The Science Journal can be used with **Arduino MKR WiFi 1010** or **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**.

* The MKR WiFi 1010 included with the Science Kit comes pre-configured for use with Science Journal. It needs to be connected using the _Science carrier board_, which is only available in the [Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-science-kit-physics-lab).
* [Follow these instructions](#firmware) if you are using an individually bought replacement, uploaded a different firmware, or are using the Nano 33 BLE Sense.
