title: "Can I use a CTC 101 invitation with an Arduino account registered with a different email address?"

If your existing Arduino account is not linked to the email address on the CTC 101 invitation, then you MUST create a new [Arduino account](https://auth.arduino.cc/login/) using that email. Otherwise, you will not be able to access the online platform.
