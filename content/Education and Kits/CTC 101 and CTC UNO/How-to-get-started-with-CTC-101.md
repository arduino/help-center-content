title: "How to get started with CTC 101"
---

To access the platform learning content, you need to create an Arduino account if you don’t already have one, and then register your product.

These are the steps:

1. Go to the [registration page](https://create.arduino.cc/ctc/reg/register-code)

2. You will be redirected to create an Arduino account or log in if you already have one. Make sure you log in with the account you want to use with the kit since this will not be possible to change later.

   If you have an account and are logged in on the browser, this step will be skipped. Again, make sure you are logged in with the account you want to use with the kit since this will not be possible to change later.

3. Once signed in, you will be redirected further to the registration page. Find the 24-digit code on the back of the lid to your toolbox and enter the code.

4. After pressing next, enter your school information in the fields given and enroll yourself as either a **teacher** or **administrator** according to your role:

   * If you are going to teach the class yourself, enroll as a **teacher** to access the learning material (all the lessons and projects).
   * If you enroll as an **administrator**, it will give you the right to enroll other teachers but not to see the learning material yourself. You will **only** have access to the Classroom Manager.

   Both teachers and administrators will have access to Classroom Manager to enroll other teachers and students.

5. Under the menu option *Training* in the menu to the right, you will find a page where you can book a personal introductory video call with one of our Arduino experts, who will help you start up and answer your questions about the program.
