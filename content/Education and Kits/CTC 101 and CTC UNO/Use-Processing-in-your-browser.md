Processing is a programming language with multiple possibilities, thanks to the effort of its community. To display your projects to this community we suggest two ways to upload and share your projects.

These tools could also help you create a collaborative environment to write your code in.

## 1. OpenProcessing

[www.openprocessing.org](www.openprocessing.org/)

OpenProcessing is an open gallery for your projects, just create an account and you can upload and execute your Processing sketches in the browser.

This website has the option to render your sketch using [p5js](https://p5js.org/) or [processingJS](http://processingjs.org/). These two modes have some different syntaxes however the processingJS mode uses the same syntax as the one you use in the Processing IDE.

## 2. SketchPad

[sketchpad.cc](sketchpad.cc/)

SketchPad will help you create a collaborative environment to write code between multiple users by just sharing the URL of the project. It also allows to share code and embed it in websites.

An interesting feature is that you can keep track of your code's versions, useful when you want to go back to any of the past interactions.
