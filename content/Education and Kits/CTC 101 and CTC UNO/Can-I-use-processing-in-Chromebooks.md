Yes, you can use Processing on Chromebooks that support Linux on ChromeOS. Most Chromebooks released after 2019, and some earlier models, allow this. Follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OteeRNblwxU) for instructions on how to install Processing on your Chromebook.

To check if your Chromebook supports Linux, visit [ChromeOS Systems Supporting Linux](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux/).

If you're using a Chromebook from a school or workplace, Linux may be disabled. In that case, ask [your administrator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6208960?sjid=7209928928643098082-EU) for help.

If you canâ€™t install Processing, you can still code Processing or p5.js projects online. See [Use Processing in your browser](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360017098499).
