We use Zoom to run all the webinars, you can download it [here](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting).

For the "Getting started" webinar, you don't really need to have anything prepared, since we will guide you through the platform, explaining the different sections. Of course, if you have already checked both the material box and the platform, you will be able to ask us any questions you've come up with.

In case you have the Full CTC 101 program, you are entitled to book up to 5 more webinar with us to discuss any questions you have later on when going through the content and projects. In these cases, we might ask you to prepare some board connections or project in order to test it live with you.
