title: "How to work with the projects that use Processing-Arduino communication in Chromebook"
---

When using Chromebooks, not being able to install programs in the laptop means that it is not possible for the Arduino Web editor's Serial port to communicate with the processing code.

The 4 projects in CTC 101 that uses communication between Processing and Arduino, and some workarounds for them are:

* Module 3 - Cookie monster: The project can be done without Processing, but no photos can be captured.

* Module 4 - Camera bot: The project can be done without Processing, but no photos can be captured.

* Module 5:

  * Asteroid Attack: can be focused on developing a game. Instead of controlling the game with the Arduino 101 board, it can be controlled using the keyboard and mouse.

  * Nova beam: Use the board only. A colored LED and a rolled paper sheet can be used for the beam.
