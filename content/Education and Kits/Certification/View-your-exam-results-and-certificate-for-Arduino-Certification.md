After completing an Arduino Certification exam, you will receive your exam result and certificate in your email inbox.

If you can't find the email, you can go to [certifications.arduino.cc](https://certifications.arduino.cc/) to see your results and download the certificate:

When you open the certification page:

- If you have passed an exam, you will see options to **Download Certificate** and review **Your Result**.
- If you see an option to **Start Exam**, it means you have not yet passed that exam for the account you are currently signed in with.
